        "full_content":"Investment giant BlackRock announced a series of changes to its sustainable fund lineup ahead of the implementation of new fund naming guidelines by EU markets regulator the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), according to a letter to BlackRock clients seen by ESG Today.\nBlackRock\u2019s platform includes more than 500 sustainable and transition investment strategies, and the firm manages over $1 trillion of sustainable and transition assets for clients. The changes will apply to 135 funds, representing approximately $185 billion in AUM, and will include enhancing sustainability characteristics for some funds, implementing a stronger transition focus for some, and removing sustainability-related terms from others.\nNotably, for funds dropping their ESG terms, BlackRock said that investment strategies, including sustainability characteristics, will remain unchanged.\nThe changes follow the release in May 2024 by ESMA of its finalized guidelines for the use of ESG and sustainability-related terms in investment fund names. ESMA launched the new rules after noting a sharp increase in the use of sustainability-related terms in fund names in Europe over the past several years, leading to an increased risk of greenwashing.\nUnder the new guidelines, funds using ESG, sustainability, or impact terms, or environmental terms such as \u201cgreen,\u201d \u201cenvironmental,\u201d or \u201cclimate,\u201d will be required to meet investment thresholds including having at least 80% of assets in investments used to meet the sustainability characteristics of the fund, and to follow the exclusion criteria for Paris Aligned Benchmarks (PABs). PAB exclusions include companies with more than 10% of revenue from oil production or refining, 1% from coal, or 50% from gas fuels production, those with most revenues coming from emissions-intensive energy generation, as well as those involved in controversial weapons, production of tobacco.\nThe new guidelines also introduced a \u201ctransition\u201d category, which includes funds labeled with terms such as \u201cimproving,\u201d \u201cprogress,\u201d \u201cevolution,\u201d and \u201ctransformation.\u201d The transition category also includes an 80% investment threshold, while applying exclusions from the EU\u2019s rules for Climate Transition Benchmarks (CTBs), instead of the more stringent PABs, in order to enable investment in companies deriving part of their revenues from fossil fuels.\nThe new guidelines come into effect on May 21, 2025. A recent study found that as many as two-thirds of funds in the EU labelled with sustainable or ESG-related terms may need to sell assets or change their names to align with new the new guidelines.\nBlackRock said that the updates to its European product range were made following consultations with a significant number of clients including large distributors, product selectors and portfolio managers.\nAmong the changes, BlackRock said that 60 funds, representing $92 billion of client AUM will enhance their sustainability characteristics, with specific changes to some including adding the PAB exclusions. 18 funds, representing $42 billion of AUM will have new transition-related terms added to their names or will adjust investment methodologies to align with transition investing objectives, while 56 funds, representing $51 billion of AUM will have sustainability-related terms removed from their names. BlackRock added that one fund will be reclassified from Article 8 to Article 6 under the SFDR regulation, while all other Article 8 or 9 funds will maintain their classifications.",

Texas has been one of the most active states in anti-ESG initiatives, with actions including having several asset managers placed on a list for potential divestment for allegedly \u201cboycotting\u201d energy companies, and more recently launching a multi-state lawsuit against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, accusing the asset managers of using their positions in climate-focused investment initiatives to manipulate energy markets.\nIn the weeks following the election, each of the firms targeted by the new letter announced withdrawals from climate-focused investment and finance coalitions, including the Net-Zero Banking Association (NZBA) and the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative.\nWhile the letter states that the AGs \u201capplaud you for terminating your relationships\u201d with the NZBA, NZAM and climate-focused engagement network Climate Action 100+ (CA100+), the AGs added that \u201cwe still want answers\u201d to decisions made by the firms while they were members of the groups, and accused the firms of potential legal violations through their support for net zero-focused shareholder resolutions and engagement practices.\nThe letter added that statements made by some of the firms reiterating their net zero commitments after leaving the groups \u201craise serious concerns as to whether your exodus is an optics-only effort.\u201d\nThe letter also warns the firms of potential legal actions related to their DEI policies, including \u201cdiscriminatory employment quotas,\u201d such as BlackRock\u2019s use of DEI goals in employee performance reviews and bonus considerations, \u201cdiscriminatory board quotas,\u201d citing BlackRock\u2019s proxy voting guideline that encourages large companies to have boards with \u201cat least two women and a director who identifies as a member of an underrepresented group\u201d as an example, and \u201cdiscriminatory supplier quotas,\u201d such as Goldman Sachs\u2019 goal to \u201cspend a cumulative $1.5 billion with small and diverse vendors between 2023 and 2025.\u201d\nThe letter includes a series of questions for each firm regarding their ESG and DEI policies, requesting responses within 45 days as an \u201copportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,\u201d and to \u201cdemonstrate whether violations have occurred, whether they will continue, and the necessity of enforcement actions to vindicate federal or State laws.\u201d\nIn a statement released alongside the letter, Texas AG Paxton said:\n\u201cBanks and financial institutions are finally starting to realize that the ESG and DEI policies pushed by radical activist groups are bad for consumers and potentially violate the law. Unlawful race- and sex-based quotas and so-called \u2018green energy\u2019 schemes will not be allowed to stand and I will continue to urge these organizations to uphold the legal obligations they owe to consumers and investors.

        "full_content":"Investment giant BlackRock announced the launch of the BlackRock BFM Brown to Green Materials Fund for UK investors, a new fund aimed at targeting overlooked opportunities stemming from the transition to a low carbon economy in the materials sector.\nThe launch marks the first UK domiciled mutual fund to use the new \u201cSustainability Improvers\u201d label introduced by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)\u2019s Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR).\nThe new fund builds on a similar strategy to BlackRock\u2019s BGF Brown to Green Materials Fund launched for European investors in 2023. The new fund will be managed by Evy Hambro, Olivia Markham and Hannah Johnson, who also manage the BGF Brown to Green Materials Fund.\nHambro said:\n\u201cThis strategy has been designed to provide clients with exposure to the Brown to Green Materials theme, recognising that what could drive share prices from here, and what could make a positive difference to the world, is what happens moving forward rather than what\u2019s already happened.\u201d\nAccording to BlackRock, the funds come as a number of sectors, beyond renewables, stand to benefit from the transition to a low-carbon economy, but may have been overlooked by investors, creating attractive investment opportunities. The new fund will invest in companies related to materials that are essential for the low carbon transition and opportunities created by decarbonizing materials supply.\nHambro added:\n\u201cWe are targeting what we believe to be an overlooked segment of the value chain for lower carbon technologies. Companies which are high emitters today, but that have credible plans to decarbonise, could offer a significant investment opportunity. As the theme broadens out even further, these companies leading emissions intensity reduction efforts in their industries could benefit from a first mover advantage as the lowcarbon materials market develops.\u201d\nBlackRock said that it anticipates that companies in the decarbonizing industries in the materials sector \u2013 including metals and mining, cement, chemicals, steel, and construction materials industries \u2013 stand to benefit as their sustainability risks decrease, leading to higher multiples, lower operational costs, and lower decarbonization capital requirements relative to their higher carbon peers.\nMarkham said:\n\u201cMaterials companies that best navigate the \u2018Brown to Green\u2019 transition could benefit from a re-rating in the valuation multiples the market is willing to pay for them. We expect global adoption of lower carbon technologies will drive stronger-than expected demand growth for materials required faster than anticipated, and this will result in higher materials prices and better-than-expected earnings for producers.\u201d\nThe FCA\u2019s SDR requirements were  introduced by the regulator to help investors assess the sustainability attributes of investment products, and to avoid greenwashing risk, to portfolio managers. The SDR included naming and marketing rules for investment products, requiring that sustainability-related terms can only be used in product names and marketing if a label is used.\nThe FCA rules introduce four labels intended to help consumers to differentiate between the sustainability objectives and investment approaches of investment products. These include Sustainability Focus, for products that aim to invest in assets that are environmentally and socially sustainable; Sustainability Improvers, investing in assets that have the potential to improve environmental and\/or social sustainability over time; Sustainability Impact, investing with an aim to achieve a predefined positive and measurable environmental or social impact, and; Sustainability Mixed Goals, a newly introduced category for funds that invest across different sustainability objectives and strategies aligned with the other categories. The rules include a series of criteria for products to use the labels, including a requirement for at least 70% of the products assets to ordinarily be invested in line with the label\u2019s objective, as well as ongoing product-level disclosures for products using a label.\nBlackRock said that the new fund will utilize the firm\u2019s proprietary \u201cSDR Improver Assessment\u201d methodology to assess companies that it invests in, ensuring that it meets the regulation\u2019s 70% threshold for the use of the Sustainability Improvers label.",

            "The new fund builds on a similar strategy to BlackRock\u2019s BGF Brown to Green Materials Fund launched for European investors in 2023. The new fund will be managed by Evy Hambro, Olivia Markham and Hannah Johnson, who also manage the BGF Brown to Green Materials Fund.",
            "According to BlackRock, the funds come as a number of sectors, beyond renewables, stand to benefit from the transition to a low-carbon economy, but may have been overlooked by investors, creating attractive investment opportunities. The new fund will invest in companies related to materials that are essential for the low carbon transition and opportunities created by decarbonizing materials supply.",
            "BlackRock said that it anticipates that companies in the decarbonizing industries in the materials sector \u2013 including metals and mining, cement, chemicals, steel, and construction materials industries \u2013 stand to benefit as their sustainability risks decrease, leading to higher multiples, lower operational costs, and lower decarbonization capital requirements relative to their higher carbon peers.",
            "BlackRock said that the new fund will utilize the firm\u2019s proprietary \u201cSDR Improver Assessment\u201d methodology to assess companies that it invests in, ensuring that it meets the regulation\u2019s 70% threshold for the use of the Sustainability Improvers label."

Commitments included working with asset owner clients on decarbonization goals, setting and reviewing interim targets for a proportion of assets to be managed in line with net zero by 2050, tracking portfolio emissions, prioritizing the achievement of emissions reductions in the sectors and companies in which they invest, and implementing a stewardship and engagement strategy \u2013 including a voting policy \u2013 consistent with a net zero by 2050 portfolio goal, among others.\nIn its update statement, NZAM announced that while it reviews the initiative, it will suspend the tracking of signatory implementation and reporting, and that it will remove its commitment statement from its website, along with the list of signatories, as well as their targets and related case studies.\nNZAM said:\n\u201cAs a voluntary initiative, NZAM has successfully supported investors globally as they have sought to navigate their own individual paths in the energy transition in line with their fiduciary duties and clients\u2019 long-term financial objectives. NZAM looks forward to continuing to play this constructive role with investors around the world.\u201d",

The round was led by by BlackRock and Temasek\u2019s decarbonization-focused fund, Decarbonization Partners.\nFounded in 2011, ConnectDER provides technology enabling households to install solar panels and chargers for EVs without requiring an upgrade in the home electricity system, while remaining connected to the grid for power when stored solar-generated power is depleted.\nAlong with the funding round announcement, ConnectDER unveiled the next generation of its Meter Socket Adapter (MSA), the \u201cIslandDER,\u201d which the company said is designed to seamlessly integrate with the utility grid, and enable islanding of solar, battery storage, EVs, and other distributed energy resources.\nIvo Steklac, CEO of ConnectDER, said:\n\u201cWith this latest Series D funding we\u2019re poised to not only expand our existing markets but also our offerings by bringing a transformative solution for energy storage systems to the market. Our forthcoming IslandDER enables homes to disconnect and reconnect from the grid enabling customers to harness stored energy from solar plus battery systems or EVs providing innovative backup power and resilience to market at an incredibly competitive cost point.\u201d\nIn the U.S., 60 million homes lack the capacity for solar, EV-charging, or resilient energy solutions without costly equipment upgrades. According to the company, its system enables households to utilize solar energy at a far lower cost than would otherwise be required to upgrade a home\u2019s service panel and\/or pay utility interconnect fees. ConnectDER said it plans to use the funds raised for market expansion, scaling manufacturing, and continued product innovation. Currently there are over 25,000 ConnectDER adapters in use across 22 states. The company said it expects to be selling them across the United States in the next few years.\nDecarbonization Partners, which led the funding round, was launched by BlackRock and Temasek in 2022, establishing a late-stage venture capital and growth private equity partnership to invest in companies providing technologies and solutions that help accelerate the transition to a net zero economy by 2050. Also participating in the round were new investors MassMutual Ventures, as well as existing investors Avista Development, Clean Energy Ventures, Energy Innovation Capital, Evergy Ventures, LG Technology Ventures, and Zoma Capital.\nDr. Meghan Sharp, Global Head and Chief Investment Officer of Decarbonization Partners, said:\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with ConnectDER, which has built an elegant solution that solves a major adoption pain point for customers, enabling and accelerating affordable home electrification in North America. We look forward to supporting the ConnectDER team as they continue executing on their growth journey.\u201d",

The company has developed a new proprietary process for the production of high-purity green methanol, using decentralized, non-fossil feedstock, low pressures, and low temperatures, enabling mass production at a competitive cost, and providing a solution to replace fossil resources in the shipping, aviation and chemical industries.\nThe company said that it will use the new capital to build a demonstration plant for its methanol production solution, with construction scheduled to begin this year.\nChristian Vollmann, CEO of C1 Green Chemicals AG, said:\n\u201cTwo ingredients are crucial for the successful commercialization of scientific innovation: talent and capital. We are delighted that we at C1 have excellent access to both ingredients.\u201d\nOf the total capital raised, \u20ac15 million came from investors led by denkapparat, the family office of the founders of German software firm Think-Cell, Markus Hannebauer and Arno Sch\u00f6dl. Planet A Ventures, Maersk Growth, SquareOne, former Linde CEO Wolfgang Reitzle and Siemens Chairman Jim Hagemann Snabe also took part in the funding round, and another \u20ac5 million came from approved research grants.\nHannebauer said:\n\u201cAt C1, everything comes together perfectly: Cutting-edge research targeting an ecologically and commercially significant problem, pragmatic founders with a clear vision, and a team boasting impressive technological and commercial expertise.

        "full_content":"Northern Europe-based financial services company Nordea announced that it has signed a deal with Norwegian startup Inherit Carbon Solutions to remove at least 68,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, providing carbon removal credits to the bank starting next year.\nThis multi-year contract is the first of what the bank says will be a portfolio of agreements with companies working on carbon removal projects. Under the agreement, Inherit will implement its system to capture CO2 from a biogas plant in Denmark. Once captured, the CO2 will be liquified and transported for geological storage under the North Sea.\nNordea announced a commitment in 2021 to become a net zero bank by 2050, along with a series of interim 2030 targets including reductions in carbon emissions from lending and investment portfolios by 40-50%, reductions in internal carbon emissions by at least 50% and the achievement of net positive carbon contribution.\nThe firm said that by the end of 2024, it had reduced emissions from its own operations by 53% compared with 2019, and with its goal to achieve net positive carbon contribution by 2030, it aims for the amount of high-quality carbon removal credits to exceed the unabated emissions from its own operations.\nPeter Sandahl, Head of Climate & Environment at Nordea said:\n\u201cThis agreement is a milestone in Nordea\u2019s new carbon removal strategy and reflects our ambition to support the scaling of high-quality carbon removal technologies. . .Through this commitment we are accelerating our operational sustainability efforts and, in addition, supporting the scaling of innovative solutions essential to reach long-term climate goals and keeping global warming within the boundaries of the Paris Agreement.\u201d\nFounded in 2021, Oslo, Norway-based Inherit captures and permanently stores CO2 released from production of renewable natural gas (RNG), which is produced from organic waste, such as agricultural, industrial, and household wastes. Unlike other carbon removal solutions, CO2 captured from RNG production doesn\u2019t have to be separated from other materials as It is created during the production of RNG, which does not contribute to climate change and is used as a fuel in the Nordics and elsewhere. After capturing carbon from biogas plants, Inherit liquifies the CO2 and transports it for permanent geological storage.\nKaja Voss, Co-CEO of Inherit, said:\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with Nordea on this groundbreaking project and to see that Nordea goes to such great lengths to accelerate the carbon removal industry. Together, we\u2019re taking an important step towards a net zero future, and we look forward to this collaboration going forward.\u201d",

        "full_content":"UBS revealed in its 2024 Sustainability Report that it has pushed back its target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in its operations by 10 years to 2035, from its prior 2025 goal, attributing the change largely due to the effect of the bank\u2019s acquisition of Credit Suisse.\nThe bank also withdrew a target for its Asset Management division to align 20% of its assets under management (AUM) with net zero by 2030, saying that it is reviewing the goal due to the integration of Credit Suisse.\nThe announcement by UBS marks the latest in a series of moves by banks globally to withdraw or pull back on climate commitments, although UBS\u2019 changes appear less drastic than those by some of its peers. HSBC, for example, recently pushed back its own target to achieve net zero emissions in its operations and supply chain by 20 years to 2050, and placed its interim financed emissions targets under review, all major U.S., Canadian and some other banks have left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, and Wells Fargo entirely dropped its target to achieve net zero financed emissions by 2050, and its sector-specific 2030 interim financed emissions targets.\nUBS remains a member of the NZBA, and in its report, the bank confirmed that it remains committed to its financed emissions decarbonization targets. UBS has 2030 financed emissions goals in place for the Swiss residential and commercial real estate, power generation, iron and steel, cement, and fossil fuel sectors.\nThe report, however, changed language on UBS\u2019 key climate commitments from its 2023 report, in which the bank said that \u201cby 2050, our ambition is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across our scope 1 and 2, and specified scope 3 activities,\u201d updating it with \u201cby 2050, the global economy aims to transition to net zero. For example, across our own operations (scopes 1 and 2), UBS plans to achieve net zero by 2035, well ahead of 2050,\u201d and outlining its Scope 3 goal as \u201caddressing our financed emissions by aligning specified sectors to decarbonization pathways.\u201d\nUBS attributed the change in its operational net zero goal to its \u201cenlarged corporate real estate portfolio following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group,\u201d as well as to \u201cthe latest definition of a \u201cnet-zero target\u201d in the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).\u201d\nAlongside the updated net zero target, UBS also set out a new interim goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 57% by 2030, on a 2023 baseline, as well as a commitment to source 100% of electricity from renewable-source-qualifying generation by 2026. For the 2035 net zero target, UBS said that it aims to reduce emissions by at least 90% before neutralizing any residual emissions through the purchase of carbon removal credits, while the interim 2030 goal does not include the use of any carbon removal credits.\nIn its Asset Management business, UBS said that it withdrew its 2030 target as it is \u201creviewing the legacy target set prior to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, taking into account all of the AuM of the combined businesses.\u201d In the report, UBS said that its assets under management with a net zero ambition reached $64.4 billion, or 3.6% of AUM (including Credit Suisse AUM), up from $35.5 billion and 2.9% of AUM in 2023 (excluding Credit Suisse AUM).",

        "full_content":"The European Commission announced the launch of its Action Plan on Steel and Metals, outlining a broad range of initiatives aimed at protecting and strengthening the industry\u2019s competitiveness, and supporting its decarbonization.\nAccording to the Commission, the new Action Plan comes as the European steel and metals industry faces a series of challenges, including high energy costs, and unfair global competition, as well as a need for investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with the sector being one of the EU\u2019s largest industrial emitters. The plan focuses on six key pillars, including ensuring access to clean and affordable energy, preventing carbon leakage, strengthening European industrial capacities, promoting circularity for metals, defending quality industrial jobs, and de-risking projects through lead markets and public support.\nThe release marks the second Action Plan, after one focused on the automotive sector, to be launched by the Commission under its new \u201cCompetitiveness Compass\u201d roadmap to boost Europe\u2019s productivity and global competitiveness. The roadmap included plans to introduce in 2025 \u201ctailor-made action plans\u201d for key energy-intensive industries, as well as plans for initiatives including a proposed \u201cIndustrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act\u201d targeting streamlined permitting for renewable energy for emissions-intensive sectors, and a review of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\nWithin the pillars focused on sector decarbonization, the Commission unveiled a series of initiatives and plans aimed at boosting the industry\u2019s access to and use of clean energy, promoting investment in clean technologies, and de-risking emissions reduction investments for companies.\nKey actions to increase the use of clean energy include promoting the use of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), encouraging member states to reduce network tariffs to alleviate electricity price volatility, promoting faster grid access and supporting the increased use of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen.\nSustainability-focused funding and incentives highlighted by the plan include plans to mobilize \u20ac100 billion in funding at scale-up stage through the \u201cIndustrial Decarbonisation Bank\u201d announced in February in the Clean Industrial Deal, starting with a \u20ac1 billion pilot auction in 2025 focusing on decarbonizing and electrifying key industrial processes.\nThe Action Plan also aims to implement measures to address \u201ccarbon leakage\u201d in the sector, a situation in which companies move production of emissions intensive goods to countries with less stringent environmental and climate policies, through revisions to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the EU\u2019s carbon tax on imported goods. Plans include introducing a legislative proposal later this year to extend the scope of CBAM to certain steel and aluminium-based downstream products and to include additional anti-circumvention measures.\nAdditionally, the Action Plan includes a series of actions aimed at boosting circularity in the metals industry, including plans to set targets for recycled steel and aluminium in key sectors, assessing whether products such as construction materials and electronics should have recycling or recycled content requirements, and considering trade measures on metal scrap to ensure sufficient availability of scrap.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said:\n\u201cThe steel industry has always been a core engine for European prosperity. Next-generation, clean steel should therefore continue to be manufactured in Europe. That means we have to help our steelmakers who are facing strong headwinds on the global market. To make sure they remain competitive, we must reduce energy costs and help them introduce innovative, low-carbon technologies to the market. With today\u2019s Action Plan we are offering concrete solutions for a thriving European steel industry.\u201d",

        "full_content":"In his first act as Canada\u2019s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney signed an order on Friday eliminating a controversial consumer carbon tax, the \u201cfuel charge,\u201d effective April 1, 2025.\nIntroduced in 2019, the fuel charge aimed to introduce a price on carbon for businesses and consumers in order to incentivize emissions reductions and to adopt cleaner technologies and products. The carbon tax started at $20 per tonne in 2019, and has been increasing annually, and was set to reach $170 per tonne in 2030.\nThe elimination of the fuel charge follows a campaign by Canada\u2019s Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre over the past several months against the carbon tax, as consumers faced high inflation. Despite championing the carbon tax in the past, Carney\u2019s campaign for Liberal party leadership acknowledged that it \u201cisn\u2019t working and has become too divisive,\u201d and pledged to cancel it.\nCarney takes the office of Prime Minister with a strong resume in both finance and climate action. He has served as the Governor of the both the Banks of Canada and of England, as the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance, as the UK Prime Minister\u2019s Finance Adviser for the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference, and as co-Chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). Prior to running for Liberal leadership, he was serving as Chair and Head of Transition Investing at Brookfield Asset Management, focused on ESG investing.\nWhile the consumer carbon tax will be ending, the carbon price on businesses will remain in place. In his leadership campaign, Carney pledged to ensure that \u201cCanada\u2019s biggest emitters will contribute their fair share,\u201d with a plan to tighten the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS) for large, industrial emitters, and to introduce a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), or a carbon tax on imports designed to prevent \u201ccarbon leakage,\u201d a situation in which companies move production of emissions intensive goods to countries with less stringent environmental and climate policies. Carney also pledged to introduce incentives for green buildings and transport electrification, and for consumer investments such as home retrofits and heat pump installations.\nIn a presentation announcing the elimination of the consumer carbon tax, Carney said:\n\u201cThis will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians, but it is part of a much bigger set of measures that this government is taking to ensure that we fight against climate change, that our companies are competitive, and the country moves forward.\u201d",

        "full_content":"U.S. Senator and Senate Banking Committee member Bill Hagerty announced the introduction of the \u201cPROTECT USA\u201d Act, proposing new legislation aimed at shielding U.S. companies from having to comply with the EU\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).\nThe CSDDD sets out obligations for companies to identify, assess, prevent, mitigate, address and remedy impacts on people and planet \u2013 ranging from child labor and slavery to pollution and emissions, deforestation and damage to ecosystems \u2013 in their upstream supply chain and some downstream activities such as distribution and recycling.\nThe legislation was adopted in May 2024, but as part of the European Commission\u2019s Omnibus process faces proposed changes, including a delay to its implementation, and a narrower scope to require companies to only perform sustainability due diligence at the level of direct business partners.\nUnder the new proposed U.S. legislation, U.S. companies in several sectors including agriculture, mining, energy, timber, and manufacturing would be prohibited from being forced to comply with the CSDDD or any foreign sustainability due diligence regulation, judgements by foreign courts in relation to such regulation would not be recognized. The proposal would also block any adverse actions taken against companies in relation to the regulations.\nSenator Hagerty said:\n\u201cAmerican companies should be governed by U.S. laws, not unaccountable lawmakers in foreign capitals. The European Union\u2019s ideologically motivated regulatory overreach is an affront to U.S. sovereignty. I will use every tool at my disposal to block it.\u201d\nThe introduction of the legislation follows the publication of a letter by the Senate Banking Committee Chairman to Trump administration officials in February expressing concerns about the potential impact of the EU\u2019s CSDDD regulation on U.S. companies, and urging the administration to \u201cengage with European counterparts to vocalize direct opposition and encourage an indefinite pause on its implementation.\u201d",

        "full_content":"The UK Government\u2019s Department for Transport announced the launch of a new consultation on an initiative aimed at supporting producers of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through the establishment of a \u201crevenue certainty mechanism\u201d (RCM) to be funded by jet-fuel suppliers.\nFuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector\u2019s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.\nThe new consultation follows the launch in January by the government of the SAF Mandate, requiring the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK\u2019s jet fuel mix, starting at 2% in 2025, and ramping up to 22% by 2040.\nEfforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.\nAmong the key barriers to ramping up SAF production is the high start-up cost, with the government estimating investments of \u00a3600 million to \u00a32 billion for new commercial plants to reach economies of scale, with new plants struggling to secure investments due to risks such as revenue uncertainty and fluctuating fuel prices.\nAccording to the Department for Transport, the new RCM plan will help to reduce risk by introducing an industry funded price guarantee to ensure steady income flow for producers, even if SAF prices fluctuate, and giving investors confidence to invest in SAF plants in the UK.\nThe consultation outlines the government\u2019s position that the RCM should be funded by industry, with a preferred approach to introduce a variable levy on suppliers of jet fuel. The proposal follows the \u201cpolluter pays principle\u201d for hard to abate sectors, and is consistent with existing schemes for renewable electricity and hydrogen. The government stated that the mechanism allows the cost to be spread across the supply chain, ensuring that it is borne by those benefiting from the supply of fossil aviation fuel.\nAviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:\n\u201cWe are committed to building the technology and fuel supply that will see greener flying become a reality in a way that protects consumers.\n\u201cAs part of our Plan for Change, these proposals will power up SAF production in the UK, support thousands of green jobs and bolster expansion plans.\u201d\nThe consultation will run until the end of March, with plans for a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Revenue Support Mechanism) Bill to be brought to Parliament in the Spring.
