The new initiatives will target Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) and diverse-led Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), and form part of the bank’s recently announced commitments to advance racial equity in the U.S. In October, JPMorgan Chase unveiled several programs to support this goal, including a pledge to channel $30 billion of financing over the next five years to underserved communities to promote economic opportunities.
Doug Petno, CEO of Commercial Banking, said:
“MDIs and CDFIs play a very important role in driving positive change in our communities. As they continue to strengthen their foundations and scale, these vital institutions will provide additional capital, resources and services to help more people and businesses in the communities that need it most.” 
The new initiatives include the launch of Empowering Change, a unique program supported by Google and in partnership with MDIs and diverse-led CDFIs to provide economic opportunity to underserved communities, enabling MDIs and CDFIs to offer new investment products to their customers, boost their technological capabilities and develop new revenues through fund distribution. JPMorgan Chase stated that Google is anchoring the program’s launch with an intent to invest $500 million in the Empower money market share class that will be initially distributed by diverse-led MDIs The Harbor Bank of Maryland, Liberty Bank and Trust, M&F Bank and Unity National Bank.
Juan Rajlin, Vice President & Treasurer at Google, said:

The agreements are expected to enable JPMorgan to match its entire unabated direct operational emissions footprint by 2030, the firm said.
Brian DiMarino, Head of Operational Sustainability at JPMorgan Chase, said:
“Alongside facilitating sustainable finance and supporting clients in the energy transition, within our operations, we’re first reducing emissions to minimize our environmental impact and then addressing what we can’t yet abate. Our goal is to remove and durably store one ton of CO₂ for every ton of unabated direct operational emissions by 2030.”
According to the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change mitigation study released last year, scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C include carbon dioxide removal methods scaling to billions of tons of removal annually over the coming decades.
The report also noted, however, that while there are multiple existing solutions to capture and store CO2, most are early stage and currently limited in scale. In addition to addressing its own unabated emissions, JPMorgan said that the new agreements are also aimed at helping accelerate the development of CDR technologies and support scaling up carbon removal projects.
Daniel Pinto, President and Chief Operating Officer at JPMorgan Chase, said:
“Financing promising technologies needed to help accelerate the low-carbon transition requires capital and expertise. We’re working to drive scalable development of carbon removal and storage as commercial solutions and aim to send a strong market signal.”
The agreements announced Tuesday by JPMorgan include one of the largest ever purchases in the direct air capture (DAC) industry, from Climeworks, valued at over $20 million, and covering the removal of 25,000 metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere over 9 years. DAC technology, listed by the IEA as a key carbon removal option in the transition to a net zero energy system, extracts CO2 directly from the atmosphere for use as a raw material or permanently removed when combined with storage.
JPMorgan also announced agreements with biomass carbon removal and storage (BiCRS) startups CO280 Solutions, for removals of up to 450,000 metric tons of CO2 over 15 years, and with Charm Industrial to remove and store approximately 28,500 metric tons over 5 years.
Additionally, JPMorgan also announced a $75 million commitment to Frontier, an advance market commitment coalition aimed at accelerating the development of carbon removal technologies with guarantees of future demand. The agreement includes purchases of $50 million for JPMorgan’s own operational emissions, as well as providing clients with access to as much as $25 million of CDR.

The letter was co-signed by 9 other state Attorneys General, including the AGs of Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia.
The letter marks the latest move in an ongoing anti-ESG and DEI campaign by Republican politicians in the U.S. over the past few years, which has gained momentum since the election of Donald Trump. Texas has been one of the most active states in anti-ESG initiatives, with actions including having several asset managers placed on a list for potential divestment for allegedly “boycotting” energy companies, and more recently launching a multi-state lawsuit against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, accusing the asset managers of using their positions in climate-focused investment initiatives to manipulate energy markets.
In the weeks following the election, each of the firms targeted by the new letter announced withdrawals from climate-focused investment and finance coalitions, including the Net-Zero Banking Association (NZBA) and the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative.
While the letter states that the AGs “applaud you for terminating your relationships” with the NZBA, NZAM and climate-focused engagement network Climate Action 100+ (CA100+), the AGs added that “we still want answers” to decisions made by the firms while they were members of the groups, and accused the firms of potential legal violations through their support for net zero-focused shareholder resolutions and engagement practices.
The letter added that statements made by some of the firms reiterating their net zero commitments after leaving the groups “raise serious concerns as to whether your exodus is an optics-only effort.”
The letter also warns the firms of potential legal actions related to their DEI policies, including “discriminatory employment quotas,” such as BlackRock’s use of DEI goals in employee performance reviews and bonus considerations, “discriminatory board quotas,” citing BlackRock’s proxy voting guideline that encourages large companies to have boards with “at least two women and a director who identifies as a member of an underrepresented group” as an example, and “discriminatory supplier quotas,” such as Goldman Sachs’ goal to “spend a cumulative $1.5 billion with small and diverse vendors between 2023 and 2025.”
The letter includes a series of questions for each firm regarding their ESG and DEI policies, requesting responses within 45 days as an “opportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,” and to “demonstrate whether violations have occurred, whether they will continue, and the necessity of enforcement actions to vindicate federal or State laws.”
In a statement released alongside the letter, Texas AG Paxton said:
“Banks and financial institutions are finally starting to realize that the ESG and DEI policies pushed by radical activist groups are bad for consumers and potentially violate the law. Unlawful race- and sex-based quotas and so-called ‘green energy’ schemes will not be allowed to stand and I will continue to urge these organizations to uphold the legal obligations they owe to consumers and investors. Any institution found to be violating the law will be held accountable.”

The departure makes JPMorgan the last large-scale U.S.-based bank to leave the NZBA, following the exit over the past few weeks of Citi, BofA, Morgan Stanley,  Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. Following the departure of JPMorgan, the only remaining U.S. banks listed on the NZBA website are Amalgamated Bank, Areti Bank, and Climate First Bank.
In a statement provided to ESG Today, a JPMorganChase spokesperson said:
“JPMC is ending our membership in the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). We will continue to work independently to advance the interests of our Firm, our shareholders and our clients and remain focused on pragmatic solutions to help further low-carbon technologies while advancing energy security. We will also continue to support the banking and investment needs of our clients who are engaged in energy transition and in decarbonizing different sectors of the economy.”
JPMorgan joined the NZBA in October 2021, shortly after the launch of the alliance. Members of the NZBA commit to transitioning operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their financing activities to align with net zero pathways by 2050, and to set 2030 financed emissions targets, initially focused on key emissions intensive sectors.
After rapidly expanding from 43 banks at launch to over 140 banks representing $74 trillion in 2024, members of the group have come under significant pressure, particularly from Republican politicians in the U.S., who have been warning financial institutions including banks, insurers, asset owners and investors of potential legal violations from their participation in climate-focused alliances and of plans to exclude the companies from state business, as part of a broader anti-ESG political campaign.
The NZBA formed part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a UN-backed umbrella group of net zero-focused financial sector coalitions, including the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM), Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA), Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance (NZFSPA), the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative (NZICI), the Paris Aligned Asset Owners (PAAO), the Venture Climate Alliance (VCA), and the Net-Zero Export Credit Agencies Alliance (NZECA).
GFANZ announced a major restructuring and repositioning earlier this month, including a shift in focus towards enabling the mass mobilization of capital to support the low carbon transition, and opening participation widely even to firms not participating in the net zero coalitions.
JPMorgan announced a commitment in October 2020 to align its financing activities with the goals of Paris Agreement, and to help clients navigate the challenges and capitalize on the long-term economic and environmental benefits of transitioning to a low-carbon world. Since joining the NZBA, the firm has set interim, net zero-aligned financed emissions reduction targets for eight sectors, including Oil & Gas, Electric Power, Auto Manufacturing, Aviation, Shipping, Iron & Steel, Cement and Aluminum. The targets remain in place on the company’s website.
The bank’s statement added that the firm plans to continue engaging with GFANZ and other groups, “to advance pragmatic solutions and market conditions that can help further a low-carbon and energy-secure future.”","JPMorganChase has chosen to exit the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, ESG Today has confirmed, marking the latest in a rapid-fire series of departures from the UN-backed coalition of banks dedicated to advancing global net zero goals through their financing activities.

jpmorgan,JPMorgan Provides $680 Million in Tax Equity Financing for Ørsted Solar and Storage Projects,"May 24, 2024",ESG Today,3,environmental,Energy developer Ørsted announced that it has received a $680 million investment in tax equity […],[],https://www.esgtoday.com/jpmorgan-provides-680-million-in-tax-equity-financing-for-orsted-solar-and-storage-projects/,direct_search,"Energy developer Ørsted announced that it has received a $680 million investment in tax equity financing from J.P. Morgan, aimed at funding the construction of new solar and storage projects in Texas and Arizona.
According to Ørsted, the investment marks one of the largest solar and storage tax equity transactions using a combined production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) structure since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Signed into law by President Biden in 2022, the IRA allocated nearly $370 billion through a series of tax credits, loans, grants and subsidies to areas including renewable energy and industrial decarbonization solutions, and for the first time made these tax credits transferable, creating a new mechanism for funding energy transition projects.
In the company’s statement announcing the investment, Ørsted said:
“This new tax credit transfer option, created by the IRA, opened a new market for any corporate buyer to support clean energy projects and optimize their federal tax bill through the purchase of tax credits.”
The financing will be used to help fund the completion of the 300 MW solar and 300 MW storage Eleven Mile Solar Center project in Pinal County, Arizona, and the 250 MW Sparta Solar project in Mineral, Texas. Under the terms of the deal, the Eleven Mile Solar Center will receive a one-time investment tax credit for its battery storage system, and the solar farm will generate production tax credits over a ten-year period.
Commercial operations for each of the projects are expected to begin this year. Ørsted announced a an agreement in December with Meta to supply the majority portion of the solar energy generated by the Eleven Mile Solar Center for Meta’s Mesa data center.
Ørsted noted that the deal builds on J.P. Morgan’s existing investments in 1.8 GW of the company’s U.S. onshore portfolio.

Under the new agreements, Vaulted Deep will remove and permanently store more than 152,000 tons of CO2 through 2027, including over 18,000 tons this year.
Launched in April 2022 with $925 million in commitments by tech companies Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify and Meta and global management consulting firm McKinsey, Frontier is an advance market commitment to buy permanent carbon removal, aimed at accelerating the development of carbon removal technologies with guarantees of future demand. In addition to setting a demand pool for carbon removal, Frontier also vets suppliers, with a focus on solutions with the potential to achieve high volume and low cost.
The agreement with Vaulted Deep is Frontier’s largest offtake deal to date. Frontier buyers were also Vaulted Deep’s first customers, through a 1,666 ton agreement in September 2023, which has already been completed and verified.
According to the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change mitigation study released last year, scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C include carbon dioxide removal methods scaling to billions of tons of removal annually over the coming decades. The report also noted, however, that while there are multiple existing solutions to capture and store CO2, most are early stage and currently limited in scale.
Spun out of injection well-focused waste management company Advantek last year, Vaulted Deep sequesters sludgy organic wastes, including biosolids, manure, agricultural, food waste, and paper sludge, and injects the carbon-rich biomass deep underground for permanent storage. The company’s approach starts with plants that naturally draw down CO₂ from the atmosphere via photosynthesis that ends up in the form of biomass would otherwise be incinerated, landfilled, or spread on land, which would re-release the CO2 back into the atmosphere. Vaulted Deep turns the waste into a carbon-rich slurry, and utilizes a proprietary slurry injection technology to inject the carbon deep underground, offering 10,000+ year permanence.
According to Vaulted Deep, its carbon removal approach includes additional benefits, including the potential to scale significantly, given an abundance of waste and flexible storage options, a line of sight to under $100 cost per ton, existing, permitted well infrastructure and expertise in deep well waste injection technology from Advantek, and health and environmental benefits from avoiding the incineration or spreading on land for disposal of the biomass.
Julia Reichelstein, CEO at Vaulted Deep, said:
“Vaulted’s technology, developed by Advantek, has been primed to address carbon removal for decades, even before there was a market. Technologies like ours that can scale quickly without compromising durability or quality will lead the way. Our proven CDR is what makes possible Frontier’s largest offtake to date.”
The new agreements include purchases by Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify, Meta, and McKinsey Sustainability, Autodesk, H&M Group, JPMorgan Chase, and Workday. Additionally, through a partnership between Frontier and climate solutions platform Watershed, companies including Aledade, Skyscanner, Canva, SKIMS, Wise, and Zendesk have also participated in the purchases. The agreements also include options to purchase more tons from future projects at lower prices.
According to Vaulted Deep, the new agreements will enable the company to commission three new wells that are sited to optimize feedstock availability, transportation, and well capacity.
Hannah Bebbington, Strategy Lead at Frontier, said:
“Vaulted went from inception to delivering thousands of tons in just four months and is now among the first carbon removal companies to sign a multi-million dollar offtake agreement. This shows what’s possible when the expertise of traditional industry players is repurposed for carbon removal.”","Carbon removal buyer coalition Frontier announced that it has facilitated a new set of carbon removal agreements totaling more than $58 million with biomass carbon removal and storage (BiCRS) provider Vaulted Deep, on behalf of a group of corporate buyers that include Stripe, Alphabet, McKinsey, H&M and JPMorgan Chase, among others.

This multi-year contract is the first of what the bank says will be a portfolio of agreements with companies working on carbon removal projects. Under the agreement, Inherit will implement its system to capture CO2 from a biogas plant in Denmark. Once captured, the CO2 will be liquified and transported for geological storage under the North Sea.
Nordea announced a commitment in 2021 to become a net zero bank by 2050, along with a series of interim 2030 targets including reductions in carbon emissions from lending and investment portfolios by 40-50%, reductions in internal carbon emissions by at least 50% and the achievement of net positive carbon contribution.
The firm said that by the end of 2024, it had reduced emissions from its own operations by 53% compared with 2019, and with its goal to achieve net positive carbon contribution by 2030, it aims for the amount of high-quality carbon removal credits to exceed the unabated emissions from its own operations.
Peter Sandahl, Head of Climate & Environment at Nordea said:
“This agreement is a milestone in Nordea’s new carbon removal strategy and reflects our ambition to support the scaling of high-quality carbon removal technologies. . .Through this commitment we are accelerating our operational sustainability efforts and, in addition, supporting the scaling of innovative solutions essential to reach long-term climate goals and keeping global warming within the boundaries of the Paris Agreement.”
Founded in 2021, Oslo, Norway-based Inherit captures and permanently stores CO2 released from production of renewable natural gas (RNG), which is produced from organic waste, such as agricultural, industrial, and household wastes. Unlike other carbon removal solutions, CO2 captured from RNG production doesn’t have to be separated from other materials as It is created during the production of RNG, which does not contribute to climate change and is used as a fuel in the Nordics and elsewhere. After capturing carbon from biogas plants, Inherit liquifies the CO2 and transports it for permanent geological storage.

The bank also withdrew a target for its Asset Management division to align 20% of its assets under management (AUM) with net zero by 2030, saying that it is reviewing the goal due to the integration of Credit Suisse.
The announcement by UBS marks the latest in a series of moves by banks globally to withdraw or pull back on climate commitments, although UBS’ changes appear less drastic than those by some of its peers. HSBC, for example, recently pushed back its own target to achieve net zero emissions in its operations and supply chain by 20 years to 2050, and placed its interim financed emissions targets under review, all major U.S., Canadian and some other banks have left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, and Wells Fargo entirely dropped its target to achieve net zero financed emissions by 2050, and its sector-specific 2030 interim financed emissions targets.
UBS remains a member of the NZBA, and in its report, the bank confirmed that it remains committed to its financed emissions decarbonization targets. UBS has 2030 financed emissions goals in place for the Swiss residential and commercial real estate, power generation, iron and steel, cement, and fossil fuel sectors.
The report, however, changed language on UBS’ key climate commitments from its 2023 report, in which the bank said that “by 2050, our ambition is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across our scope 1 and 2, and specified scope 3 activities,” updating it with “by 2050, the global economy aims to transition to net zero. For example, across our own operations (scopes 1 and 2), UBS plans to achieve net zero by 2035, well ahead of 2050,” and outlining its Scope 3 goal as “addressing our financed emissions by aligning specified sectors to decarbonization pathways.”
UBS attributed the change in its operational net zero goal to its “enlarged corporate real estate portfolio following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group,” as well as to “the latest definition of a “net-zero target” in the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).”
Alongside the updated net zero target, UBS also set out a new interim goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 57% by 2030, on a 2023 baseline, as well as a commitment to source 100% of electricity from renewable-source-qualifying generation by 2026. For the 2035 net zero target, UBS said that it aims to reduce emissions by at least 90% before neutralizing any residual emissions through the purchase of carbon removal credits, while the interim 2030 goal does not include the use of any carbon removal credits.
In its Asset Management business, UBS said that it withdrew its 2030 target as it is “reviewing the legacy target set prior to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, taking into account all of the AuM of the combined businesses.” In the report, UBS said that its assets under management with a net zero ambition reached $64.4 billion, or 3.6% of AUM (including Credit Suisse AUM), up from $35.5 billion and 2.9% of AUM in 2023 (excluding Credit Suisse AUM).",,0.0,[],False,1.0,positive,6.0,0.0,[],0.0

According to the Commission, the new Action Plan comes as the European steel and metals industry faces a series of challenges, including high energy costs, and unfair global competition, as well as a need for investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with the sector being one of the EU’s largest industrial emitters. The plan focuses on six key pillars, including ensuring access to clean and affordable energy, preventing carbon leakage, strengthening European industrial capacities, promoting circularity for metals, defending quality industrial jobs, and de-risking projects through lead markets and public support.
The release marks the second Action Plan, after one focused on the automotive sector, to be launched by the Commission under its new “Competitiveness Compass” roadmap to boost Europe’s productivity and global competitiveness. The roadmap included plans to introduce in 2025 “tailor-made action plans” for key energy-intensive industries, as well as plans for initiatives including a proposed “Industrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act” targeting streamlined permitting for renewable energy for emissions-intensive sectors, and a review of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).
Within the pillars focused on sector decarbonization, the Commission unveiled a series of initiatives and plans aimed at boosting the industry’s access to and use of clean energy, promoting investment in clean technologies, and de-risking emissions reduction investments for companies.
Key actions to increase the use of clean energy include promoting the use of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), encouraging member states to reduce network tariffs to alleviate electricity price volatility, promoting faster grid access and supporting the increased use of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen.
Sustainability-focused funding and incentives highlighted by the plan include plans to mobilize €100 billion in funding at scale-up stage through the “Industrial Decarbonisation Bank” announced in February in the Clean Industrial Deal, starting with a €1 billion pilot auction in 2025 focusing on decarbonizing and electrifying key industrial processes.
The Action Plan also aims to implement measures to address “carbon leakage” in the sector, a situation in which companies move production of emissions intensive goods to countries with less stringent environmental and climate policies, through revisions to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the EU’s carbon tax on imported goods. Plans include introducing a legislative proposal later this year to extend the scope of CBAM to certain steel and aluminium-based downstream products and to include additional anti-circumvention measures.
Additionally, the Action Plan includes a series of actions aimed at boosting circularity in the metals industry, including plans to set targets for recycled steel and aluminium in key sectors, assessing whether products such as construction materials and electronics should have recycling or recycled content requirements, and considering trade measures on metal scrap to ensure sufficient availability of scrap.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said:
“The steel industry has always been a core engine for European prosperity. Next-generation, clean steel should therefore continue to be manufactured in Europe. That means we have to help our steelmakers who are facing strong headwinds on the global market. To make sure they remain competitive, we must reduce energy costs and help them introduce innovative, low-carbon technologies to the market.

Introduced in 2019, the fuel charge aimed to introduce a price on carbon for businesses and consumers in order to incentivize emissions reductions and to adopt cleaner technologies and products. The carbon tax started at $20 per tonne in 2019, and has been increasing annually, and was set to reach $170 per tonne in 2030.
The elimination of the fuel charge follows a campaign by Canada’s Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre over the past several months against the carbon tax, as consumers faced high inflation. Despite championing the carbon tax in the past, Carney’s campaign for Liberal party leadership acknowledged that it “isn’t working and has become too divisive,” and pledged to cancel it.
Carney takes the office of Prime Minister with a strong resume in both finance and climate action. He has served as the Governor of the both the Banks of Canada and of England, as the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance, as the UK Prime Minister’s Finance Adviser for the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference, and as co-Chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). Prior to running for Liberal leadership, he was serving as Chair and Head of Transition Investing at Brookfield Asset Management, focused on ESG investing.
While the consumer carbon tax will be ending, the carbon price on businesses will remain in place. In his leadership campaign, Carney pledged to ensure that “Canada’s biggest emitters will contribute their fair share,” with a plan to tighten the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS) for large, industrial emitters, and to introduce a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), or a carbon tax on imports designed to prevent “carbon leakage,” a situation in which companies move production of emissions intensive goods to countries with less stringent environmental and climate policies. Carney also pledged to introduce incentives for green buildings and transport electrification, and for consumer investments such as home retrofits and heat pump installations.
In a presentation announcing the elimination of the consumer carbon tax, Carney said:

jpmorgan,Senate Republicans Launch Legislation to Shield U.S. Companies from EU Sustainability Due Diligence Rules,"March 13, 2025",ESG Today,0,environmental,Excerpt not available,[],https://www.esgtoday.com/senate-republicans-launch-legislation-to-shield-u-s-companies-from-eu-sustainability-due-diligence-rules/,direct_search,"U.S. Senator and Senate Banking Committee member Bill Hagerty announced the introduction of the “PROTECT USA” Act, proposing new legislation aimed at shielding U.S. companies from having to comply with the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).
The CSDDD sets out obligations for companies to identify, assess, prevent, mitigate, address and remedy impacts on people and planet – ranging from child labor and slavery to pollution and emissions, deforestation and damage to ecosystems – in their upstream supply chain and some downstream activities such as distribution and recycling.
The legislation was adopted in May 2024, but as part of the European Commission’s Omnibus process faces proposed changes, including a delay to its implementation, and a narrower scope to require companies to only perform sustainability due diligence at the level of direct business partners.
Under the new proposed U.S. legislation, U.S. companies in several sectors including agriculture, mining, energy, timber, and manufacturing would be prohibited from being forced to comply with the CSDDD or any foreign sustainability due diligence regulation, judgements by foreign courts in relation to such regulation would not be recognized. The proposal would also block any adverse actions taken against companies in relation to the regulations.
Senator Hagerty said:
“American companies should be governed by U.S. laws, not unaccountable lawmakers in foreign capitals. The European Union’s ideologically motivated regulatory overreach is an affront to U.S. sovereignty. I will use every tool at my disposal to block it.”
The introduction of the legislation follows the publication of a letter by the Senate Banking Committee Chairman to Trump administration officials in February expressing concerns about the potential impact of the EU’s CSDDD regulation on U.S. companies, and urging the administration to “engage with European counterparts to vocalize direct opposition and encourage an indefinite pause on its implementation.”",,0.0,[],False,-1.0,negative,0.0,1.0,[],0.0
jpmorgan,UK Plans Levy on Jet Fuel Producers to Fund Sustainable Aviation Fuel “Revenue Certainty Mechanism”,"March 10, 2025",ESG Today,0,environmental,Excerpt not available,[],https://www.esgtoday.com/uk-plans-levy-on-jet-fuel-producers-to-fund-revenue-certainty-mechanism-for-sustainable-aviation-fuel-development/,direct_search,"The UK Government’s Department for Transport announced the launch of a new consultation on an initiative aimed at supporting producers of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through the establishment of a “revenue certainty mechanism” (RCM) to be funded by jet-fuel suppliers.
Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.
The new consultation follows the launch in January by the government of the SAF Mandate, requiring the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK’s jet fuel mix, starting at 2% in 2025, and ramping up to 22% by 2040.
Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.
Among the key barriers to ramping up SAF production is the high start-up cost, with the government estimating investments of £600 million to £2 billion for new commercial plants to reach economies of scale, with new plants struggling to secure investments due to risks such as revenue uncertainty and fluctuating fuel prices.
According to the Department for Transport, the new RCM plan will help to reduce risk by introducing an industry funded price guarantee to ensure steady income flow for producers, even if SAF prices fluctuate, and giving investors confidence to invest in SAF plants in the UK.
The consultation outlines the government’s position that the RCM should be funded by industry, with a preferred approach to introduce a variable levy on suppliers of jet fuel. The proposal follows the “polluter pays principle” for hard to abate sectors, and is consistent with existing schemes for renewable electricity and hydrogen. The government stated that the mechanism allows the cost to be spread across the supply chain, ensuring that it is borne by those benefiting from the supply of fossil aviation fuel.
Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:
“We are committed to building the technology and fuel supply that will see greener flying become a reality in a way that protects consumers.
“As part of our Plan for Change, these proposals will power up SAF production in the UK, support thousands of green jobs and bolster expansion plans.”
The consultation will run until the end of March, with plans for a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Revenue Support Mechanism) Bill to be brought to Parliament in the Spring. Click here to access the consultation.",,0.0,[],False,0.6,positive,4.0,1.0,[],0.0
