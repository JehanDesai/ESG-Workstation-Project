Our goal is to remove and durably store one ton of CO\u2082 for every ton of unabated direct operational emissions by 2030.\u201d\nAccording to the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change mitigation study released last year, scenarios that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C include carbon dioxide removal methods scaling to billions of tons of removal annually over the coming decades.\nThe report also noted, however, that while there are multiple existing solutions to capture and store CO2, most are early stage and currently limited in scale. In addition to addressing its own unabated emissions, JPMorgan said that the new agreements are also aimed at helping accelerate the development of CDR technologies and support scaling up carbon removal projects.\nDaniel Pinto, President and Chief Operating Officer at JPMorgan Chase, said:\n\u201cFinancing promising technologies needed to help accelerate the low-carbon transition requires capital and expertise. We\u2019re working to drive scalable development of carbon removal and storage as commercial solutions and aim to send a strong market signal.\u201d\nThe agreements announced Tuesday by JPMorgan include one of the largest ever purchases in the direct air capture (DAC) industry, from Climeworks, valued at over $20 million, and covering the removal of 25,000 metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere over 9 years. DAC technology, listed by the IEA as a key carbon removal option in the transition to a net zero energy system, extracts CO2 directly from the atmosphere for use as a raw material or permanently removed when combined with storage.\nJPMorgan also announced agreements with biomass carbon removal and storage (BiCRS) startups CO280 Solutions, for removals of up to 450,000 metric tons of CO2 over 15 years, and with Charm Industrial to remove and store approximately 28,500 metric tons over 5 years.\nAdditionally, JPMorgan also announced a $75 million commitment to Frontier, an advance market commitment coalition aimed at accelerating the development of carbon removal technologies with guarantees of future demand. The agreement includes purchases of $50 million for JPMorgan\u2019s own operational emissions, as well as providing clients with access to as much as $25 million of CDR.\nHeather Zichal, Global Head of Sustainability at JPMorgan Chase, said:\n\u201cThese agreements will meaningfully contribute to moving carbon removal forward as a solution available to a wider range of buyers, including our clients.\u201d",

Texas has been one of the most active states in anti-ESG initiatives, with actions including having several asset managers placed on a list for potential divestment for allegedly \u201cboycotting\u201d energy companies, and more recently launching a multi-state lawsuit against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, accusing the asset managers of using their positions in climate-focused investment initiatives to manipulate energy markets.\nIn the weeks following the election, each of the firms targeted by the new letter announced withdrawals from climate-focused investment and finance coalitions, including the Net-Zero Banking Association (NZBA) and the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative.\nWhile the letter states that the AGs \u201capplaud you for terminating your relationships\u201d with the NZBA, NZAM and climate-focused engagement network Climate Action 100+ (CA100+), the AGs added that \u201cwe still want answers\u201d to decisions made by the firms while they were members of the groups, and accused the firms of potential legal violations through their support for net zero-focused shareholder resolutions and engagement practices.\nThe letter added that statements made by some of the firms reiterating their net zero commitments after leaving the groups \u201craise serious concerns as to whether your exodus is an optics-only effort.\u201d\nThe letter also warns the firms of potential legal actions related to their DEI policies, including \u201cdiscriminatory employment quotas,\u201d such as BlackRock\u2019s use of DEI goals in employee performance reviews and bonus considerations, \u201cdiscriminatory board quotas,\u201d citing BlackRock\u2019s proxy voting guideline that encourages large companies to have boards with \u201cat least two women and a director who identifies as a member of an underrepresented group\u201d as an example, and \u201cdiscriminatory supplier quotas,\u201d such as Goldman Sachs\u2019 goal to \u201cspend a cumulative $1.5 billion with small and diverse vendors between 2023 and 2025.\u201d\nThe letter includes a series of questions for each firm regarding their ESG and DEI policies, requesting responses within 45 days as an \u201copportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,\u201d and to \u201cdemonstrate whether violations have occurred, whether they will continue, and the necessity of enforcement actions to vindicate federal or State laws.\u201d\nIn a statement released alongside the letter, Texas AG Paxton said:\n\u201cBanks and financial institutions are finally starting to realize that the ESG and DEI policies pushed by radical activist groups are bad for consumers and potentially violate the law. Unlawful race- and sex-based quotas and so-called \u2018green energy\u2019 schemes will not be allowed to stand and I will continue to urge these organizations to uphold the legal obligations they owe to consumers and investors.

Since joining the NZBA, the firm has set interim, net zero-aligned financed emissions reduction targets for eight sectors, including Oil & Gas, Electric Power, Auto Manufacturing, Aviation, Shipping, Iron & Steel, Cement and Aluminum. The targets remain in place on the company\u2019s website.\nThe bank\u2019s statement added that the firm plans to continue engaging with GFANZ and other groups, \u201cto advance pragmatic solutions and market conditions that can help further a low-carbon and energy-secure future.\u201d",

Morgan, aimed at funding the construction of new solar and storage projects in Texas and Arizona.\nAccording to \u00d8rsted, the investment marks one of the largest solar and storage tax equity transactions using a combined production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) structure since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Signed into law by President Biden in 2022, the IRA allocated nearly $370 billion through a series of tax credits, loans, grants and subsidies to areas including renewable energy and industrial decarbonization solutions, and for the first time made these tax credits transferable, creating a new mechanism for funding energy transition projects.\nIn the company\u2019s statement announcing the investment, \u00d8rsted said:\n\u201cThis new tax credit transfer option, created by the IRA, opened a new market for any corporate buyer to support clean energy projects and optimize their federal tax bill through the purchase of tax credits.\u201d\nThe financing will be used to help fund the completion of the 300 MW solar and 300 MW storage Eleven Mile Solar Center project in Pinal County, Arizona, and the 250 MW Sparta Solar project in Mineral, Texas. Under the terms of the deal, the Eleven Mile Solar Center will receive a one-time investment tax credit for its battery storage system, and the solar farm will generate production tax credits over a ten-year period.\nCommercial operations for each of the projects are expected to begin this year. \u00d8rsted announced a an agreement in December with Meta to supply the majority portion of the solar energy generated by the Eleven Mile Solar Center for Meta\u2019s Mesa data center.\n\u00d8rsted noted that the deal builds on J.P. Morgan\u2019s existing investments in 1.8 GW of the company\u2019s U.S. onshore portfolio.\nJames Giamarino, Chief Commercial Officer for the Americas at \u00d8rsted, said:\n\u201c\u00d8rsted is an experienced developer and operator of renewable energy projects in the U.S., including offshore and onshore wind, solar, and battery storage, all of which will generate tax credits valuable to investors. With this new market unlocked by the IRA, we\u2019re excited to continue our tax equity partnership with J.P.

In addition to setting a demand pool for carbon removal, Frontier also vets suppliers, with a focus on solutions with the potential to achieve high volume and low cost.\nThe agreement with Vaulted Deep is Frontier\u2019s largest offtake deal to date. Frontier buyers were also Vaulted Deep\u2019s first customers, through a 1,666 ton agreement in September 2023, which has already been completed and verified.\nAccording to the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change mitigation study released last year, scenarios that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C include carbon dioxide removal methods scaling to billions of tons of removal annually over the coming decades. The report also noted, however, that while there are multiple existing solutions to capture and store CO2, most are early stage and currently limited in scale.\nSpun out of injection well-focused waste management company Advantek last year, Vaulted Deep sequesters sludgy organic wastes, including biosolids, manure, agricultural, food waste, and paper sludge, and injects the carbon-rich biomass deep underground for permanent storage. The company\u2019s approach starts with plants that naturally draw down CO\u2082 from the atmosphere via photosynthesis that ends up in the form of biomass would otherwise be incinerated, landfilled, or spread on land, which would re-release the CO2 back into the atmosphere. Vaulted Deep turns the waste into a carbon-rich slurry, and utilizes a proprietary slurry injection technology to inject the carbon deep underground, offering 10,000+ year permanence.\nAccording to Vaulted Deep, its carbon removal approach includes additional benefits, including the potential to scale significantly, given an abundance of waste and flexible storage options, a line of sight to under $100 cost per ton, existing, permitted well infrastructure and expertise in deep well waste injection technology from Advantek, and health and environmental benefits from avoiding the incineration or spreading on land for disposal of the biomass.\nJulia Reichelstein, CEO at Vaulted Deep, said:\n\u201cVaulted\u2019s technology, developed by Advantek, has been primed to address carbon removal for decades, even before there was a market. Technologies like ours that can scale quickly without compromising durability or quality will lead the way. Our proven CDR is what makes possible Frontier\u2019s largest offtake to date.\u201d\nThe new agreements include purchases by Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify, Meta, and McKinsey Sustainability, Autodesk, H&M Group, JPMorgan Chase, and Workday. Additionally, through a partnership between Frontier and climate solutions platform Watershed, companies including Aledade, Skyscanner, Canva, SKIMS, Wise, and Zendesk have also participated in the purchases. The agreements also include options to purchase more tons from future projects at lower prices.\nAccording to Vaulted Deep, the new agreements will enable the company to commission three new wells that are sited to optimize feedstock availability, transportation, and well capacity.\nHannah Bebbington, Strategy Lead at Frontier, said:\n\u201cVaulted went from inception to delivering thousands of tons in just four months and is now among the first carbon removal companies to sign a multi-million dollar offtake agreement. This shows what\u2019s possible when the expertise of traditional industry players is repurposed for carbon removal.\u201d",

Through Puro.earth\u2019s platform, and based on its carbon credit methodologies, suppliers that remove CO2 from the atmosphere to durable storage of at least 100 years are certified and issued CO2 Removal Certificates (CORCs) into the Puro Registry, which can then be purchased by companies.\nPuro.earth said that it took nearly five years from its first CORCs issuances in 2019 to reach 500,000 issued CORCs in Q1 2024, with growth growing exponentially to reach 1 million CORCs only one year later.\nThe company added that it is on track for issuance of the next million CORCs before the end of H1 2026.\nPuro.earth President Jan-Willem Bode said:\n\u201cReaching one million of CO\u2082 removals is just the beginning\u2014our goal is to continue to use our expertise and track record to deliver proven, scalable and high-quality carbon removal credits. The next million is already within reach, and we will continue to ensure that businesses worldwide have access to trusted, verifiable carbon removal credits, at scale.\u201d\nBy methodology, Puro.earth said that Geologically Stored Carbon (GSC)\u2013 such as Direct Air Capture Carbon and Storage (DACCS) and Bio Energy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) \u2013 and Biochar, have been particularly popular with buyers, each representing more than 34% of issuances, as they offer scalable, high-impact solutions for carbon removal with well-defined processes and measurable outcomes. By location, the U.S. leads issuances by a wide margin, at 45%, followed by Finland at 9.9%, Bolivia at 9.6% and Brazil at 9.2%., with other strong markets including Austria, Norway, and the UK.\nPuro.earth attributed shifting buyer sentiment as a key factor in the sector\u2019s growth, noting buyers such as Microsoft, Google, and the Frontier Buyers that have led in the development of the early-stage durable CDR market, allowing technologies and suppliers to scale.

Once captured, the CO2 will be liquified and transported for geological storage under the North Sea.\nNordea announced a commitment in 2021 to become a net zero bank by 2050, along with a series of interim 2030 targets including reductions in carbon emissions from lending and investment portfolios by 40-50%, reductions in internal carbon emissions by at least 50% and the achievement of net positive carbon contribution.\nThe firm said that by the end of 2024, it had reduced emissions from its own operations by 53% compared with 2019, and with its goal to achieve net positive carbon contribution by 2030, it aims for the amount of high-quality carbon removal credits to exceed the unabated emissions from its own operations.\nPeter Sandahl, Head of Climate & Environment at Nordea said:\n\u201cThis agreement is a milestone in Nordea\u2019s new carbon removal strategy and reflects our ambition to support the scaling of high-quality carbon removal technologies. . .Through this commitment we are accelerating our operational sustainability efforts and, in addition, supporting the scaling of innovative solutions essential to reach long-term climate goals and keeping global warming within the boundaries of the Paris Agreement.\u201d\nFounded in 2021, Oslo, Norway-based Inherit captures and permanently stores CO2 released from production of renewable natural gas (RNG), which is produced from organic waste, such as agricultural, industrial, and household wastes. Unlike other carbon removal solutions, CO2 captured from RNG production doesn\u2019t have to be separated from other materials as It is created during the production of RNG, which does not contribute to climate change and is used as a fuel in the Nordics and elsewhere. After capturing carbon from biogas plants, Inherit liquifies the CO2 and transports it for permanent geological storage.\nKaja Voss, Co-CEO of Inherit, said:\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with Nordea on this groundbreaking project and to see that Nordea goes to such great lengths to accelerate the carbon removal industry. Together, we\u2019re taking an important step towards a net zero future, and we look forward to this collaboration going forward.\u201d",

        "full_content":"UBS revealed in its 2024 Sustainability Report that it has pushed back its target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in its operations by 10 years to 2035, from its prior 2025 goal, attributing the change largely due to the effect of the bank\u2019s acquisition of Credit Suisse.\nThe bank also withdrew a target for its Asset Management division to align 20% of its assets under management (AUM) with net zero by 2030, saying that it is reviewing the goal due to the integration of Credit Suisse.\nThe announcement by UBS marks the latest in a series of moves by banks globally to withdraw or pull back on climate commitments, although UBS\u2019 changes appear less drastic than those by some of its peers. HSBC, for example, recently pushed back its own target to achieve net zero emissions in its operations and supply chain by 20 years to 2050, and placed its interim financed emissions targets under review, all major U.S., Canadian and some other banks have left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, and Wells Fargo entirely dropped its target to achieve net zero financed emissions by 2050, and its sector-specific 2030 interim financed emissions targets.\nUBS remains a member of the NZBA, and in its report, the bank confirmed that it remains committed to its financed emissions decarbonization targets. UBS has 2030 financed emissions goals in place for the Swiss residential and commercial real estate, power generation, iron and steel, cement, and fossil fuel sectors.\nThe report, however, changed language on UBS\u2019 key climate commitments from its 2023 report, in which the bank said that \u201cby 2050, our ambition is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across our scope 1 and 2, and specified scope 3 activities,\u201d updating it with \u201cby 2050, the global economy aims to transition to net zero. For example, across our own operations (scopes 1 and 2), UBS plans to achieve net zero by 2035, well ahead of 2050,\u201d and outlining its Scope 3 goal as \u201caddressing our financed emissions by aligning specified sectors to decarbonization pathways.\u201d\nUBS attributed the change in its operational net zero goal to its \u201cenlarged corporate real estate portfolio following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group,\u201d as well as to \u201cthe latest definition of a \u201cnet-zero target\u201d in the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).\u201d\nAlongside the updated net zero target, UBS also set out a new interim goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 57% by 2030, on a 2023 baseline, as well as a commitment to source 100% of electricity from renewable-source-qualifying generation by 2026. For the 2035 net zero target, UBS said that it aims to reduce emissions by at least 90% before neutralizing any residual emissions through the purchase of carbon removal credits, while the interim 2030 goal does not include the use of any carbon removal credits.\nIn its Asset Management business, UBS said that it withdrew its 2030 target as it is \u201creviewing the legacy target set prior to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, taking into account all of the AuM of the combined businesses.\u201d In the report, UBS said that its assets under management with a net zero ambition reached $64.4 billion, or 3.6% of AUM (including Credit Suisse AUM), up from $35.5 billion and 2.9% of AUM in 2023 (excluding Credit Suisse AUM).",

        "full_content":"The European Commission announced the launch of its Action Plan on Steel and Metals, outlining a broad range of initiatives aimed at protecting and strengthening the industry\u2019s competitiveness, and supporting its decarbonization.\nAccording to the Commission, the new Action Plan comes as the European steel and metals industry faces a series of challenges, including high energy costs, and unfair global competition, as well as a need for investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with the sector being one of the EU\u2019s largest industrial emitters. The plan focuses on six key pillars, including ensuring access to clean and affordable energy, preventing carbon leakage, strengthening European industrial capacities, promoting circularity for metals, defending quality industrial jobs, and de-risking projects through lead markets and public support.\nThe release marks the second Action Plan, after one focused on the automotive sector, to be launched by the Commission under its new \u201cCompetitiveness Compass\u201d roadmap to boost Europe\u2019s productivity and global competitiveness. The roadmap included plans to introduce in 2025 \u201ctailor-made action plans\u201d for key energy-intensive industries, as well as plans for initiatives including a proposed \u201cIndustrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act\u201d targeting streamlined permitting for renewable energy for emissions-intensive sectors, and a review of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\nWithin the pillars focused on sector decarbonization, the Commission unveiled a series of initiatives and plans aimed at boosting the industry\u2019s access to and use of clean energy, promoting investment in clean technologies, and de-risking emissions reduction investments for companies.\nKey actions to increase the use of clean energy include promoting the use of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), encouraging member states to reduce network tariffs to alleviate electricity price volatility, promoting faster grid access and supporting the increased use of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen.\nSustainability-focused funding and incentives highlighted by the plan include plans to mobilize \u20ac100 billion in funding at scale-up stage through the \u201cIndustrial Decarbonisation Bank\u201d announced in February in the Clean Industrial Deal, starting with a \u20ac1 billion pilot auction in 2025 focusing on decarbonizing and electrifying key industrial processes.\nThe Action Plan also aims to implement measures to address \u201ccarbon leakage\u201d in the sector, a situation in which companies move production of emissions intensive goods to countries with less stringent environmental and climate policies, through revisions to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the EU\u2019s carbon tax on imported goods. Plans include introducing a legislative proposal later this year to extend the scope of CBAM to certain steel and aluminium-based downstream products and to include additional anti-circumvention measures.\nAdditionally, the Action Plan includes a series of actions aimed at boosting circularity in the metals industry, including plans to set targets for recycled steel and aluminium in key sectors, assessing whether products such as construction materials and electronics should have recycling or recycled content requirements, and considering trade measures on metal scrap to ensure sufficient availability of scrap.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said:\n\u201cThe steel industry has always been a core engine for European prosperity. Next-generation, clean steel should therefore continue to be manufactured in Europe. That means we have to help our steelmakers who are facing strong headwinds on the global market. To make sure they remain competitive, we must reduce energy costs and help them introduce innovative, low-carbon technologies to the market. With today\u2019s Action Plan we are offering concrete solutions for a thriving European steel industry.\u201d",

The carbon tax started at $20 per tonne in 2019, and has been increasing annually, and was set to reach $170 per tonne in 2030.\nThe elimination of the fuel charge follows a campaign by Canada\u2019s Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre over the past several months against the carbon tax, as consumers faced high inflation. Despite championing the carbon tax in the past, Carney\u2019s campaign for Liberal party leadership acknowledged that it \u201cisn\u2019t working and has become too divisive,\u201d and pledged to cancel it.\nCarney takes the office of Prime Minister with a strong resume in both finance and climate action. He has served as the Governor of the both the Banks of Canada and of England, as the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance, as the UK Prime Minister\u2019s Finance Adviser for the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference, and as co-Chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). Prior to running for Liberal leadership, he was serving as Chair and Head of Transition Investing at Brookfield Asset Management, focused on ESG investing.\nWhile the consumer carbon tax will be ending, the carbon price on businesses will remain in place. In his leadership campaign, Carney pledged to ensure that \u201cCanada\u2019s biggest emitters will contribute their fair share,\u201d with a plan to tighten the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS) for large, industrial emitters, and to introduce a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), or a carbon tax on imports designed to prevent \u201ccarbon leakage,\u201d a situation in which companies move production of emissions intensive goods to countries with less stringent environmental and climate policies. Carney also pledged to introduce incentives for green buildings and transport electrification, and for consumer investments such as home retrofits and heat pump installations.\nIn a presentation announcing the elimination of the consumer carbon tax, Carney said:\n\u201cThis will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians, but it is part of a much bigger set of measures that this government is taking to ensure that we fight against climate change, that our companies are competitive, and the country moves forward.\u201d",

        "full_content":"U.S. Senator and Senate Banking Committee member Bill Hagerty announced the introduction of the \u201cPROTECT USA\u201d Act, proposing new legislation aimed at shielding U.S. companies from having to comply with the EU\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).\nThe CSDDD sets out obligations for companies to identify, assess, prevent, mitigate, address and remedy impacts on people and planet \u2013 ranging from child labor and slavery to pollution and emissions, deforestation and damage to ecosystems \u2013 in their upstream supply chain and some downstream activities such as distribution and recycling.\nThe legislation was adopted in May 2024, but as part of the European Commission\u2019s Omnibus process faces proposed changes, including a delay to its implementation, and a narrower scope to require companies to only perform sustainability due diligence at the level of direct business partners.\nUnder the new proposed U.S. legislation, U.S. companies in several sectors including agriculture, mining, energy, timber, and manufacturing would be prohibited from being forced to comply with the CSDDD or any foreign sustainability due diligence regulation, judgements by foreign courts in relation to such regulation would not be recognized. The proposal would also block any adverse actions taken against companies in relation to the regulations.\nSenator Hagerty said:\n\u201cAmerican companies should be governed by U.S. laws, not unaccountable lawmakers in foreign capitals. The European Union\u2019s ideologically motivated regulatory overreach is an affront to U.S. sovereignty. I will use every tool at my disposal to block it.\u201d\nThe introduction of the legislation follows the publication of a letter by the Senate Banking Committee Chairman to Trump administration officials in February expressing concerns about the potential impact of the EU\u2019s CSDDD regulation on U.S. companies, and urging the administration to \u201cengage with European counterparts to vocalize direct opposition and encourage an indefinite pause on its implementation.\u201d",

        "full_content":"The UK Government\u2019s Department for Transport announced the launch of a new consultation on an initiative aimed at supporting producers of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through the establishment of a \u201crevenue certainty mechanism\u201d (RCM) to be funded by jet-fuel suppliers.\nFuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector\u2019s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.\nThe new consultation follows the launch in January by the government of the SAF Mandate, requiring the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK\u2019s jet fuel mix, starting at 2% in 2025, and ramping up to 22% by 2040.\nEfforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.\nAmong the key barriers to ramping up SAF production is the high start-up cost, with the government estimating investments of \u00a3600 million to \u00a32 billion for new commercial plants to reach economies of scale, with new plants struggling to secure investments due to risks such as revenue uncertainty and fluctuating fuel prices.\nAccording to the Department for Transport, the new RCM plan will help to reduce risk by introducing an industry funded price guarantee to ensure steady income flow for producers, even if SAF prices fluctuate, and giving investors confidence to invest in SAF plants in the UK.\nThe consultation outlines the government\u2019s position that the RCM should be funded by industry, with a preferred approach to introduce a variable levy on suppliers of jet fuel. The proposal follows the \u201cpolluter pays principle\u201d for hard to abate sectors, and is consistent with existing schemes for renewable electricity and hydrogen. The government stated that the mechanism allows the cost to be spread across the supply chain, ensuring that it is borne by those benefiting from the supply of fossil aviation fuel.\nAviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:\n\u201cWe are committed to building the technology and fuel supply that will see greener flying become a reality in a way that protects consumers.\n\u201cAs part of our Plan for Change, these proposals will power up SAF production in the UK, support thousands of green jobs and bolster expansion plans.\u201d\nThe consultation will run until the end of March, with plans for a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Revenue Support Mechanism) Bill to be brought to Parliament in the Spring.
