The new projects will be deployed over the next three years, and will expand access to clean energy and drive economic development in about 20 American communities with carbon-intense grids, Clearloop said, while helping Microsoft meet its carbon reduction goals
The new projects will provide solar energy for communities in Arkansas and Louisiana, diversifying the energy mix in those states and preventing more than 5 million metric tons of carbon from entering the atmosphere over the next four decades, Clearloop said. Studies show that solar accounts for just 1.3% of the energy mix in Arkansas, and 0.3% in Louisiana, both well below the US average of 4.0%, industry experts said.
By matching customer electricity usage with new renewable energy generation, Microsoft will be able to take advantage of emission offsets. This will help support Microsoft’s goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030.
Danielle Decatur, Microsoft Director of Environmental Justice, said:
“Clearloop helps Microsoft achieve its carbon negative goals by supporting renewable energy projects in communities across the country that might otherwise miss out on the economic and environmental benefits of the energy transition.”
Clearloop helps create solutions for organizations to decarbonize the economy and accelerate the development of new solar projects in American communities where significant economic and environmental benefits can be achieved.  Working with environmental tech nonprofit WattTime, Nashville-based Clearloop was an early pioneer of using emissions factors to identify strategic points on the grid where new solar generation can significantly accelerate decarbonization and expand equitable access to clean energy.
The first four solar projects in the multi-year agreement are set to break ground over the next few months and will be operational by year’s end, the companies said. These will be among the first large-scale solar projects interconnecting and serving the local distribution grids in Poinsett County, Cross County, and Desha County in Arkansas, as well as Bienville Parish in Louisiana.
As part of this agreement with Microsoft, Clearloop will create a Community Benefits Fund, managed by nonprofit Sustain Our Future Foundation, to support positive outcomes for local communities impacted by unhealthy social and environmental conditions.
Laura Zapata, Clearloop CEO and Co-founder, said:
“We applaud Microsoft for using its purchasing power to pilot and scale innovative structures that accelerate grid decarbonization in a way that ensures all American communities can see themselves represented as we transform our economy with clean, innovative technologies. Community-centric climate action by forward-thinking companies like Microsoft—recognizing that not all megawatt hours have the same carbon impact—are making access to carbon-free energy by more Americans possible.”","Microsoft has signed an agreement with carbon solution firm Clearloop for the deployment of up to 100 megawatts of renewable energy projects, aimed at bringing clean energy to disadvantaged communities.

In a blog post discussing Microsoft’s progress towards its 2030 targets, however, Nakagawa reiterated that the company remains committed to its climate goals, and said that while AI presented sustainability challenges, it will also form the basis of the solutions needed to achieve climate ambitions.
Nakagawa said:
“Already, we are seeing AI make a positive impact on the planet, and in the coming years, this technology will begin to rapidly accelerate climate solutions at a scale we’ve not yet seen.”
Microsoft launched a series of moonshot sustainability goals in 2020, including commitments to become carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030, as well as to protect more land than it uses by that date.
In the company’s environmental sustainability report released last year, however, Microsoft revealed that its Scope 3 emissions, which account for the vast majority of the company’s carbon footprint, were actually more than 30% higher in 2023 than in 2020, driven largely by significant growth in data centers to meet increasing demand for AI computing power. Microsoft has since announced a series of measures to help address its value chain emissions footprint, including introducing a policy for some of its key suppliers to use 100% carbon-free electricity, and launching a new supplier decarbonization team focused on tackling emissions from cloud and AI operations.
In her post, Nakagawa highlights some of the Microsoft’s key achievements towards reaching its 2030 goals, including becoming one of the world’s largest carbon-free energy buyers with a 34 GW renewable energy portfolio spanning 24 countries, growing its water replenishment portfolio to 90 projects in over 40 locations, improving the repairability of its hardware products, and surpassing its land protection goal by more than 40%.
Despite the achievements, however, Nakagawa said that “we know that our work is far from over, and that the path ahead has gotten harder,” and adding that “the world is not on track to meet critical climate goals and we see many of these challenges reflected in our own journey.”
Nakagawa’s post also indicated a key shift in Microsoft’s climate strategy. Microsoft introduced a carbon fee in 2012, charged to business groups within the company based on their emissions footprint – and extended to cover all Scope 3 emissions in 2020 – to help fund the company’s carbon neutrality commitment. In her post, Nakagawa said that stopped using proceeds from the fee to purchase unbundled renewable energy certificates, refocusing instead “on more long-term, higher-impact investments,” including carbon reduction, carbon removal and procuring clean electricity.
Nakagawa said:
“We are proud to continue making decisions that drive positive environmental impact in the market and deliver high-integrity investments. We remain resolute in our commitment to our climate goals and to empowering others with the technology needed to build a more sustainable future.”
Nakagawa joined Microsoft as CSO in early 2023, after serving in the Biden administration White House as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Climate and Energy on the National Security Council, where she played a leadership role on international and domestic climate initiatives, including working on the U.S.’ return to the Paris Agreement, and on energy issues including the international energy response to the war in Ukraine.

The three new projects include the 140 MW Wolf Run Solar Project, and the 110 MW Hickory Solar Project both located in southern Illinois, and the 150 MW Cattlemen II Solar Project located near Austin, Texas.
The two Illinois projects created 500 construction jobs the companies said. The projects have also contributed $4.8 million to landowners, who lease a portion of their land to the projects, and millions of dollars to local governments through tax payments. Those payments, the companies said, ensure that critical services, schools, road maintenance, and other local initiatives are well-funded. The companies added that Cattlemen II in Texas will also contribute millions in taxes, benefiting the local school district and local government. That project created approximately 300 construction jobs.
The operations of these three projects will continue to increase local spending at service providers, restaurants, hotels, and other retailers near the project communities, with more than $10.4 million spent to date during construction, the companies added.
Sandhya Ganapathy, CEO of EDP Renewables North America, said:
“The importance of ensuring benefits flowing from renewable energy development directly into communities has never been more important. Through these three additional projects, we’re keeping our promise – and indeed the industry’s promise – to contribute to the nation’s growing energy demand and in that process invest in long-lasting economic growth of our communities.”
For the Hickory project, EDPR NA and Microsoft used an Environmental Justice PPA (EJ PPA), developed by Microsoft and Volt Energy Utility, LLC (Volt Energy Utility), a minority-owned renewable energy developer focused on making clean energy investments in communities disproportionately impacted by pollution and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
With the EJ PPA, Hickory will contribute funding to enable Sharing the Power Foundation, a non-profit that seeks to advance environmental justice and contribute to an equitable distribution of benefits produced by the clean energy economy. The funding will help provide financial assistance to organizations and causes that ensure equal access to clean air, water, and renewable energy, as well as offer availability to energy assistance programs and opportunities to pursue workforce training in clean energy careers.
The companies said that in addition to providing clean energy and economic growth, the projects will also support Microsoft’s sustainability and carbon reduction goals. In 2021, Microsoft launched a “100/100/0 clean energy goal,” with the company targeting having 100% of its electricity consumption, 100% percent of the time, matched by purchases from zero carbon energy sources by 2030, adding to its prior commitment to use 100% renewable energy in its buildings and datacenters globally by 2025. Microsoft has also committed to become carbon negative by 2030, and to cover 100% of its electricity consumption in its buildings and datacenters globally with renewable energy by 2025.
Kourtney Nelson, Senior Director of Renewable Energy Procurement at Microsoft, said:
“It’s exciting when projects achieve commercial operations and begin generating clean energy in support of grid decarbonization. We’re pleased with EDPR NA and Volt Energy Utility’s collaboration on Hickory and the positive impact the project will have with community grants and investing in future renewable energy leaders.”

The deal marks the largest-ever voluntary corporate investment in conservation forestry in the U.S., according to Chestnut Carbon, restoring approximately 60,000 acres of land, and planting more than 35 million native, biodiverse hardwood and softwood trees.
Launched in 2022 by energy sector-focused alternative asset manager Kimmeridge, Chestnut helps reduce carbon emissions by planting and developing long-term forest projects that create biodiverse ecosystems and community benefits. Chestnut’s projects acquire marginal crop and pasture lands, and partners with local foresters, nurseries, and community members to develop an ideal forest ecosystem based on native tree species, soil, drainage, and community land use.
The new agreement will provide carbon removal credits from Chestnut’s afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation (ARR) project in Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana. Key features of the project highlighted by Chestnut included the durability of its carbon sequestration, and additionality, with the lands not being restored in the absence of the carbon market, as well as environmental and stakeholder benefits such as improvements to native wildlife habitats, air and water quality, expansion of land use alternatives, community engagement and economic development.
According to Chestnut, the new agreement with Microsoft will enable it to grow its ARR portfolio to 500,000 acres by 2030 and to remove 100 million tons of CO2 from the atmosphere over a 50-year crediting period.
Ben Dell, CEO of Chestnut and Managing Partner of Kimmeridge, said:
“We’re excited to be expanding our collaboration with Microsoft given their market leadership in net zero commitments and the signing of a second agreement within the span of a year reaffirms their view that Chestnut is delivering high quality removal credits. We’re confident in our belief that nature-based afforestation solutions are the most attractive, scalable, and cost-effective means for removing carbon from the atmosphere today. We continue to bring high-quality credits to market for discerning customers and look forward to building on our leading position in the market.”
The new transaction adds to an initial 15-year agreement between Microsoft and Chestnut in December 2023 for up to 3 million tons of carbon credits, and marks a further expansion to Microsoft’s diverse portfolio of carbon removal projects, forming part of the tech giant’s initiative to become carbon negative by 2030. The portfolio includes several large-scale reforestation-based agreements, including a 3.5 million ton deal announced earlier this month with Brazil-based re.green, in addition to technologies including, ocean-based carbon removal, and biochar-based projects, and direct air capture (DAC) agreements.

The announcement follows the release by Microsoft earlier this year of its “Datacenter Community Pledge,” aimed at ensuring that the company’s growing datacenter footprint serves helps to address societal challenges and create benefits in local communities. The pledge included a commitment  to “design and operate our datacenters to support society’s climate goals and become carbon negative, water positive and zero waste before 2030.”
Datacenters generate a great deal of heat, and generally use a chilled water circuit to absorb the heat generated by equipment. According to experts, the average mid-sized data center in the US utilizes around 300,000 gallons of water a day – as much as is used by 1,000 US households, making data centers alone among the top ten commercial and industrial users of water in the country.
Microsoft said that its new datacenter projects to be built in Phoenix, Arizona, and Mt. Pleasant, Wisconsin, will pilot cooling systems that do not consume water. These new datacenters are the first ones that will be based on new designs that use a next-generation cooling technology that avoids water evaporation, which the company says will save as much as 125 million liters of water per year per datacenter. The new sites will begin coming online in late 2027, Microsoft said, and all new Microsoft datacenter designs have begun using the new cooling technology.
According to Microsoft, the new liquid cooling technologies recycle water through a closed loop. Water is filled into the system when the data center is under construction, and that water will continually circulate between the servers and chillers to dissipate heat without requiring a fresh water supply.
In addition to the new cooling design, Microsoft said it has been taking other steps to reduce water usage. Based on its Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) measurement, its efforts improved water use efficiency in its last fiscal year by 39% over the amount used in FY 2021. Those savings, Microsoft said, were in part fueled by expanded use of alternative water sources, such as reclaimed and recycled water, in data centers in Texas, Washington, California, and Singapore.
In a post highlighting the new design, Steve Solomon, Vice President, Datacenter Infrastructure Engineering at Microsoft, said:
“We have been working since the early 2000s to reduce water use and improved our WUE by 80% since our first generation of datacenters. As water challenges grow more extreme, we know we have more work to do. The shift to the next generation datacenters is expected to help reduce our WUE to near zero for each datacenter employing zero-water evaporation. As our fleet expands over time, this shift will help reduce Microsoft’s fleetwide WUE even further.”","Microsoft announced the launch of a new datacenter design, optimizing AI workloads and avoiding the consumption of water for cooling, supporting the company’s datacenter-focused sustainability goals.

The new initiatives come as Microsoft looks to address the growing emissions impact of its rapidly expanding datacenter footprints. While Microsoft has set 2030 goals to become carbon negative and to reduce Scope 3 emissions by more than half compared to 2020, the company recently reported that Scope 3 emissions in 2023 were actually more than 30% higher than in 2020, driven by the construction of datacenters, including embodied carbon in building materials as well as hardware components.
Construction materials such as steel and concrete are among the most significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with steel manufacturing and cement production accounting for approximately 7% and 8%, respectively, of global carbon emissions, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF).
Among the key initiatives announced by Microsoft is the use of cross-laminated timber (CLT), a lightweight, superstrong and fire-resistant prefabricated wood material in two new datacenters under construction in northern Virginia, that will enable reductions in the use of steel and concrete.
CLT is produced by gluing together multiple layers of timber stacked in alternate directions, which is then pressed into a solid panel. Typically made of spruce, pine or Douglas fir, CLT is stronger, lighter and more stable than ordinary wood, and the material performs better than steel at high temperatures by developing a layer of char that provides insulation and maintains the integrity of the structure.
In the new datacenters, CLT will be used to displace a portion of the thick concrete typically used for flooring and ceilings, resulting in a much lighter building requiring much less steel.
According to Microsoft, the use of CLT in the new datacenters is estimated to reduce embodied carbon for the facilities by 35% compared to conventional steel construction, and by 65% compared to typical precast concrete.
Jim Hanna, who leads sustainability for Microsoft’s datacenter engineering team, said:
“We have to be system thinkers across the entire value chain of these materials that go into our datacenters and the equipment that supplies our datacenters.”
Additional initiatives the company said it is taking to reduce the embodied carbon footprint of its datacenters include updating contract language to include low-carbon requirements for materials and equipment used in datacenter construction, and investments in low-carbon building materials technologies and developers, such as Stegra (formerly H2 Green Steel), Boston Metal, CarbonCure, and Prometheus Materials through the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund.
Brandon Middaugh, who manages the Climate Innovation Fund program and strategy, said:
“Part of the solution is (figuring out) how do you make sure that our suppliers have the enabling technologies they need to develop the green solution.”

This multi-year contract is the first of what the bank says will be a portfolio of agreements with companies working on carbon removal projects. Under the agreement, Inherit will implement its system to capture CO2 from a biogas plant in Denmark. Once captured, the CO2 will be liquified and transported for geological storage under the North Sea.
Nordea announced a commitment in 2021 to become a net zero bank by 2050, along with a series of interim 2030 targets including reductions in carbon emissions from lending and investment portfolios by 40-50%, reductions in internal carbon emissions by at least 50% and the achievement of net positive carbon contribution.
The firm said that by the end of 2024, it had reduced emissions from its own operations by 53% compared with 2019, and with its goal to achieve net positive carbon contribution by 2030, it aims for the amount of high-quality carbon removal credits to exceed the unabated emissions from its own operations.
Peter Sandahl, Head of Climate & Environment at Nordea said:
“This agreement is a milestone in Nordea’s new carbon removal strategy and reflects our ambition to support the scaling of high-quality carbon removal technologies. . .Through this commitment we are accelerating our operational sustainability efforts and, in addition, supporting the scaling of innovative solutions essential to reach long-term climate goals and keeping global warming within the boundaries of the Paris Agreement.”
Founded in 2021, Oslo, Norway-based Inherit captures and permanently stores CO2 released from production of renewable natural gas (RNG), which is produced from organic waste, such as agricultural, industrial, and household wastes. Unlike other carbon removal solutions, CO2 captured from RNG production doesn’t have to be separated from other materials as It is created during the production of RNG, which does not contribute to climate change and is used as a fuel in the Nordics and elsewhere. After capturing carbon from biogas plants, Inherit liquifies the CO2 and transports it for permanent geological storage.

The bank also withdrew a target for its Asset Management division to align 20% of its assets under management (AUM) with net zero by 2030, saying that it is reviewing the goal due to the integration of Credit Suisse.
The announcement by UBS marks the latest in a series of moves by banks globally to withdraw or pull back on climate commitments, although UBS’ changes appear less drastic than those by some of its peers. HSBC, for example, recently pushed back its own target to achieve net zero emissions in its operations and supply chain by 20 years to 2050, and placed its interim financed emissions targets under review, all major U.S., Canadian and some other banks have left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, and Wells Fargo entirely dropped its target to achieve net zero financed emissions by 2050, and its sector-specific 2030 interim financed emissions targets.
UBS remains a member of the NZBA, and in its report, the bank confirmed that it remains committed to its financed emissions decarbonization targets. UBS has 2030 financed emissions goals in place for the Swiss residential and commercial real estate, power generation, iron and steel, cement, and fossil fuel sectors.
The report, however, changed language on UBS’ key climate commitments from its 2023 report, in which the bank said that “by 2050, our ambition is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across our scope 1 and 2, and specified scope 3 activities,” updating it with “by 2050, the global economy aims to transition to net zero. For example, across our own operations (scopes 1 and 2), UBS plans to achieve net zero by 2035, well ahead of 2050,” and outlining its Scope 3 goal as “addressing our financed emissions by aligning specified sectors to decarbonization pathways.”
UBS attributed the change in its operational net zero goal to its “enlarged corporate real estate portfolio following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group,” as well as to “the latest definition of a “net-zero target” in the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).”
Alongside the updated net zero target, UBS also set out a new interim goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 57% by 2030, on a 2023 baseline, as well as a commitment to source 100% of electricity from renewable-source-qualifying generation by 2026. For the 2035 net zero target, UBS said that it aims to reduce emissions by at least 90% before neutralizing any residual emissions through the purchase of carbon removal credits, while the interim 2030 goal does not include the use of any carbon removal credits.
In its Asset Management business, UBS said that it withdrew its 2030 target as it is “reviewing the legacy target set prior to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, taking into account all of the AuM of the combined businesses.” In the report, UBS said that its assets under management with a net zero ambition reached $64.4 billion, or 3.6% of AUM (including Credit Suisse AUM), up from $35.5 billion and 2.9% of AUM in 2023 (excluding Credit Suisse AUM).",,0,[],False,1.0,positive,6,0,[],0

According to the Commission, the new Action Plan comes as the European steel and metals industry faces a series of challenges, including high energy costs, and unfair global competition, as well as a need for investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with the sector being one of the EU’s largest industrial emitters. The plan focuses on six key pillars, including ensuring access to clean and affordable energy, preventing carbon leakage, strengthening European industrial capacities, promoting circularity for metals, defending quality industrial jobs, and de-risking projects through lead markets and public support.
The release marks the second Action Plan, after one focused on the automotive sector, to be launched by the Commission under its new “Competitiveness Compass” roadmap to boost Europe’s productivity and global competitiveness. The roadmap included plans to introduce in 2025 “tailor-made action plans” for key energy-intensive industries, as well as plans for initiatives including a proposed “Industrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act” targeting streamlined permitting for renewable energy for emissions-intensive sectors, and a review of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).
Within the pillars focused on sector decarbonization, the Commission unveiled a series of initiatives and plans aimed at boosting the industry’s access to and use of clean energy, promoting investment in clean technologies, and de-risking emissions reduction investments for companies.
Key actions to increase the use of clean energy include promoting the use of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), encouraging member states to reduce network tariffs to alleviate electricity price volatility, promoting faster grid access and supporting the increased use of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen.
Sustainability-focused funding and incentives highlighted by the plan include plans to mobilize €100 billion in funding at scale-up stage through the “Industrial Decarbonisation Bank” announced in February in the Clean Industrial Deal, starting with a €1 billion pilot auction in 2025 focusing on decarbonizing and electrifying key industrial processes.
The Action Plan also aims to implement measures to address “carbon leakage” in the sector, a situation in which companies move production of emissions intensive goods to countries with less stringent environmental and climate policies, through revisions to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the EU’s carbon tax on imported goods. Plans include introducing a legislative proposal later this year to extend the scope of CBAM to certain steel and aluminium-based downstream products and to include additional anti-circumvention measures.
Additionally, the Action Plan includes a series of actions aimed at boosting circularity in the metals industry, including plans to set targets for recycled steel and aluminium in key sectors, assessing whether products such as construction materials and electronics should have recycling or recycled content requirements, and considering trade measures on metal scrap to ensure sufficient availability of scrap.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said:
“The steel industry has always been a core engine for European prosperity. Next-generation, clean steel should therefore continue to be manufactured in Europe. That means we have to help our steelmakers who are facing strong headwinds on the global market. To make sure they remain competitive, we must reduce energy costs and help them introduce innovative, low-carbon technologies to the market. With today’s Action Plan we are offering concrete solutions for a thriving European steel industry.”",,0,[],False,1.0,positive,1,0,[],0
microsoft,Carney Eliminates Canada’s Consumer Carbon Tax,"March 17, 2025",ESG Today,0,environmental,Excerpt not available,[],https://www.esgtoday.com/carney-eliminates-canadas-consumer-carbon-tax/,direct_search,"In his first act as Canada’s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney signed an order on Friday eliminating a controversial consumer carbon tax, the “fuel charge,” effective April 1, 2025.
Introduced in 2019, the fuel charge aimed to introduce a price on carbon for businesses and consumers in order to incentivize emissions reductions and to adopt cleaner technologies and products. The carbon tax started at $20 per tonne in 2019, and has been increasing annually, and was set to reach $170 per tonne in 2030.
The elimination of the fuel charge follows a campaign by Canada’s Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre over the past several months against the carbon tax, as consumers faced high inflation. Despite championing the carbon tax in the past, Carney’s campaign for Liberal party leadership acknowledged that it “isn’t working and has become too divisive,” and pledged to cancel it.
Carney takes the office of Prime Minister with a strong resume in both finance and climate action. He has served as the Governor of the both the Banks of Canada and of England, as the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance, as the UK Prime Minister’s Finance Adviser for the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference, and as co-Chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). Prior to running for Liberal leadership, he was serving as Chair and Head of Transition Investing at Brookfield Asset Management, focused on ESG investing.
While the consumer carbon tax will be ending, the carbon price on businesses will remain in place. In his leadership campaign, Carney pledged to ensure that “Canada’s biggest emitters will contribute their fair share,” with a plan to tighten the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS) for large, industrial emitters, and to introduce a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), or a carbon tax on imports designed to prevent “carbon leakage,” a situation in which companies move production of emissions intensive goods to countries with less stringent environmental and climate policies. Carney also pledged to introduce incentives for green buildings and transport electrification, and for consumer investments such as home retrofits and heat pump installations.
In a presentation announcing the elimination of the consumer carbon tax, Carney said:
“This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians, but it is part of a much bigger set of measures that this government is taking to ensure that we fight against climate change, that our companies are competitive, and the country moves forward.”",,0,[],False,1.0,positive,2,0,[],0
microsoft,Senate Republicans Launch Legislation to Shield U.S. Companies from EU Sustainability Due Diligence Rules,"March 13, 2025",ESG Today,0,environmental,Excerpt not available,[],https://www.esgtoday.com/senate-republicans-launch-legislation-to-shield-u-s-companies-from-eu-sustainability-due-diligence-rules/,direct_search,"U.S. Senator and Senate Banking Committee member Bill Hagerty announced the introduction of the “PROTECT USA” Act, proposing new legislation aimed at shielding U.S. companies from having to comply with the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).
The CSDDD sets out obligations for companies to identify, assess, prevent, mitigate, address and remedy impacts on people and planet – ranging from child labor and slavery to pollution and emissions, deforestation and damage to ecosystems – in their upstream supply chain and some downstream activities such as distribution and recycling.
The legislation was adopted in May 2024, but as part of the European Commission’s Omnibus process faces proposed changes, including a delay to its implementation, and a narrower scope to require companies to only perform sustainability due diligence at the level of direct business partners.
Under the new proposed U.S. legislation, U.S. companies in several sectors including agriculture, mining, energy, timber, and manufacturing would be prohibited from being forced to comply with the CSDDD or any foreign sustainability due diligence regulation, judgements by foreign courts in relation to such regulation would not be recognized. The proposal would also block any adverse actions taken against companies in relation to the regulations.
Senator Hagerty said:
“American companies should be governed by U.S. laws, not unaccountable lawmakers in foreign capitals. The European Union’s ideologically motivated regulatory overreach is an affront to U.S. sovereignty. I will use every tool at my disposal to block it.”
The introduction of the legislation follows the publication of a letter by the Senate Banking Committee Chairman to Trump administration officials in February expressing concerns about the potential impact of the EU’s CSDDD regulation on U.S. companies, and urging the administration to “engage with European counterparts to vocalize direct opposition and encourage an indefinite pause on its implementation.”",,0,[],False,-1.0,negative,0,1,[],0
microsoft,UK Plans Levy on Jet Fuel Producers to Fund Sustainable Aviation Fuel “Revenue Certainty Mechanism”,"March 10, 2025",ESG Today,0,environmental,Excerpt not available,[],https://www.esgtoday.com/uk-plans-levy-on-jet-fuel-producers-to-fund-revenue-certainty-mechanism-for-sustainable-aviation-fuel-development/,direct_search,"The UK Government’s Department for Transport announced the launch of a new consultation on an initiative aimed at supporting producers of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through the establishment of a “revenue certainty mechanism” (RCM) to be funded by jet-fuel suppliers.
Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.
The new consultation follows the launch in January by the government of the SAF Mandate, requiring the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK’s jet fuel mix, starting at 2% in 2025, and ramping up to 22% by 2040.
Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.
Among the key barriers to ramping up SAF production is the high start-up cost, with the government estimating investments of £600 million to £2 billion for new commercial plants to reach economies of scale, with new plants struggling to secure investments due to risks such as revenue uncertainty and fluctuating fuel prices.
According to the Department for Transport, the new RCM plan will help to reduce risk by introducing an industry funded price guarantee to ensure steady income flow for producers, even if SAF prices fluctuate, and giving investors confidence to invest in SAF plants in the UK.
The consultation outlines the government’s position that the RCM should be funded by industry, with a preferred approach to introduce a variable levy on suppliers of jet fuel. The proposal follows the “polluter pays principle” for hard to abate sectors, and is consistent with existing schemes for renewable electricity and hydrogen. The government stated that the mechanism allows the cost to be spread across the supply chain, ensuring that it is borne by those benefiting from the supply of fossil aviation fuel.
Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:
“We are committed to building the technology and fuel supply that will see greener flying become a reality in a way that protects consumers.
“As part of our Plan for Change, these proposals will power up SAF production in the UK, support thousands of green jobs and bolster expansion plans.”
The consultation will run until the end of March, with plans for a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Revenue Support Mechanism) Bill to be brought to Parliament in the Spring. Click here to access the consultation.",,0,[],False,0.6,positive,4,1,[],0
