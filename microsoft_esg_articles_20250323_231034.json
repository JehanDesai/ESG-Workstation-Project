        "full_content":"Climate solutions-focused investment business Just Climate announced that it has raised $175 million for its Natural Climate Solutions strategy, aimed at directing capital to businesses focused on natural climate solutions to transform land use to achieve global net-zero and nature positive goals, while also delivering attractive returns.\nInvestors backing the strategy include California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (CalSTRS) as institutional anchor, and Microsoft\u2019s Climate Innovation Fund as corporate anchor.\nFounded in 2021 by Generation Investment Management, a sustainability-focused investment firm chaired by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, Just Climate aims to deliver impact by focusing on scaling solutions for the highest-emitting, most off-track sectors of the economy, investing in climate solutions that can radically reduce or remove emissions, while generating attractive risk-adjusted financial returns.\nThe firm unveiled the Natural Climate Solutions strategy in September 2023, led by Co-Chief Investment Officer Eduardo Mufarej. The strategy is designed to support entrepreneurs with growth capital and business building support to scale solutions to help transform the way agricultural commodities are produced and to restore degraded landscapes, such as biological fertilizers and pesticides to replace chemicals, as well as development models to finance and operate restoration projects, and technologies to verify carbon and biodiversity outcomes.\nJust Climate has grown its Natural Climate Solutions team to 12 investment professionals, based in London, San Francisco and S\u00e3o Paulo. The strategy recently announced its first investment, leading a $25 million Series B capital raise for biodiversity measurement and monitoring solution provider NatureMetrics in January 2025.\nMufarej said:\n\u201cWe believe a rapid land transition, with the potential to be as profound as the energy transition, is coming. Our strategy focuses on directing and scaling institutional capital to solutions that can help to transform food systems and drive the expansion of the ecosystem restoration sector. \u201c\nMicrosoft and CalSTRS both also backed Just Climate\u2019s $1.5 billion Industrial Climate Solutions strategy, with Microsoft\u2019s Climate Innovation Fund as an anchor investor. Microsoft is a also founding member of the Just Climate Nature Alliance, a group of corporate leaders whose influence and expertise is expected to play a vital role in expanding the natural climate solutions investment opportunity.\nErika Basham, Director at Microsoft\u2019s Climate Innovation Fund, said:\n\u201cOur work with Just Climate and participation in the Just Climate Nature Alliance reflect our commitment to advancing nature-based solutions that drive high-integrity carbon removals, build resilient supply chains and protect biodiversity.\u201d",

        "full_content":"Microsoft, carbon markets solutions provider Climate Impact Partners, and climate-focused project finance business Terra Natural Capital announced today a new finance and carbon removal purchase agreement, aimed at supporting the development of a large-scale afforestation project in India.\nAs part of the agreement, Microsoft will will purchase 1.5 million tonnes of verified carbon removal credits over 30 years, representing 50% of the project\u2019s projected 3 million tonne output.\nThe new agreement brings together project development expertise from Climate Impact Partners, finance from Terra Natural Capital, and a long-term purchase commitment from Microsoft, supporting the Panna afforestation project in the Madhya Pradesh State, India. The project, spanning 20,000 hectares, will see up to 11.6 million mixed native trees planted across farmer and community land.\nErica Vertefeuille, Managing Director, Terra Natural Capital said:\n\u201cThis transaction reflects the power of collaboration between trusted project developers, corporate demand, and innovative finance to unlock climate impact. We recognize that access to project finance is a critical need for the carbon removal market to scale and are committed to providing long-term capital that will accelerate project development and empower corporates to achieve their climate targets.\u201d\nThe agreement marks Microsoft\u2019s first carbon removal purchase in India for Microsoft, and forms part of the tech giant\u2019s rapidly expanding carbon credit portfolio, part of the company\u2019s initiative to become carbon negative by 2030. The portfolio includes several large-scale afforestation and reforestation-based agreements, including a 7 million ton deal announced in January with Chestnut Carbon, in addition to technologies including, ocean-based carbon removal, and biochar-based projects, and direct air capture (DAC) agreements.\nBrian Marrs, Senior Director Energy Markets, Microsoft said:\n\u201cAt Microsoft, we believe that high-quality, nature-based solutions are vital to addressing climate change. Panna forms an important part of our growing portfolio of carbon removal projects \u2013 our first in India and largest in the APAC region. The collaboration with Climate Impact Partners helps to ensure that millions more trees are planted, more carbon is removed from the atmosphere, more jobs are created, and more finance flows back to local communities.\u201d\nIn addition to the carbon removal, the companies highlighted other key benefits of the project, including economic empowerment through a share of carbon credit sales to farmers and income generation from the sale of fruit and medicinal produce from the trees planted, training programs on climate-smart agricultural techniques to help enhance long-term yields, the implementation of large-scale water infrastructure to capture and conserve water, and improved biodiversity by focusing on native species and attracting butterfly and bird species back to currently degraded lands.\nSheri Hickok, CEO, Climate Impact Partners said:\n\u201cBy securing a long-term supply of high-quality carbon credits, this model empowers companies like Microsoft to meet their ambitious climate targets, drive growth in the carbon removal market, and bring benefits to communities most impacted by climate change. Panna exemplifies how companies can help scale large-scale carbon removal infrastructure.\u201d",

        "full_content":"Microsoft has signed an agreement with carbon solution firm Clearloop for the deployment of up to 100 megawatts of renewable energy projects, aimed at bringing clean energy to disadvantaged communities.\nThe new projects will be deployed over the next three years, and will expand access to clean energy and drive economic development in about 20 American communities with carbon-intense grids, Clearloop said, while helping Microsoft meet its carbon reduction goals\nThe new projects will provide solar energy for communities in Arkansas and Louisiana, diversifying the energy mix in those states and preventing more than 5 million metric tons of carbon from entering the atmosphere over the next four decades, Clearloop said. Studies show that solar accounts for just 1.3% of the energy mix in Arkansas, and 0.3% in Louisiana, both well below the US average of 4.0%, industry experts said.\nBy matching customer electricity usage with new renewable energy generation, Microsoft will be able to take advantage of emission offsets. This will help support Microsoft\u2019s goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030.\nDanielle Decatur, Microsoft Director of Environmental Justice, said:\n\u201cClearloop helps Microsoft achieve its carbon negative goals by supporting renewable energy projects in communities across the country that might otherwise miss out on the economic and environmental benefits of the energy transition.\u201d\nClearloop helps create solutions for organizations to decarbonize the economy and accelerate the development of new solar projects in American communities where significant economic and environmental benefits can be achieved.  Working with environmental tech nonprofit WattTime, Nashville-based Clearloop was an early pioneer of using emissions factors to identify strategic points on the grid where new solar generation can significantly accelerate decarbonization and expand equitable access to clean energy.\nThe first four solar projects in the multi-year agreement are set to break ground over the next few months and will be operational by year\u2019s end, the companies said. These will be among the first large-scale solar projects interconnecting and serving the local distribution grids in Poinsett County, Cross County, and Desha County in Arkansas, as well as Bienville Parish in Louisiana.\nAs part of this agreement with Microsoft, Clearloop will create a Community Benefits Fund, managed by nonprofit Sustain Our Future Foundation, to support positive outcomes for local communities impacted by unhealthy social and environmental conditions.\nLaura Zapata, Clearloop CEO and Co-founder, said:\n\u201cWe applaud Microsoft for using its purchasing power to pilot and scale innovative structures that accelerate grid decarbonization in a way that ensures all American communities can see themselves represented as we transform our economy with clean, innovative technologies. Community-centric climate action by forward-thinking companies like Microsoft\u2014recognizing that not all megawatt hours have the same carbon impact\u2014are making access to carbon-free energy by more Americans possible.\u201d",

The projects have also contributed $4.8 million to landowners, who lease a portion of their land to the projects, and millions of dollars to local governments through tax payments. Those payments, the companies said, ensure that critical services, schools, road maintenance, and other local initiatives are well-funded. The companies added that Cattlemen II in Texas will also contribute millions in taxes, benefiting the local school district and local government. That project created approximately 300 construction jobs.\nThe operations of these three projects will continue to increase local spending at service providers, restaurants, hotels, and other retailers near the project communities, with more than $10.4 million spent to date during construction, the companies added.\nSandhya Ganapathy, CEO of EDP Renewables North America, said:\n\u201cThe importance of ensuring benefits flowing from renewable energy development directly into communities has never been more important. Through these three additional projects, we\u2019re keeping our promise \u2013 and indeed the industry\u2019s promise \u2013 to contribute to the nation\u2019s growing energy demand and in that process invest in long-lasting economic growth of our communities.\u201d\nFor the Hickory project, EDPR NA and Microsoft used an Environmental Justice PPA (EJ PPA), developed by Microsoft and Volt Energy Utility, LLC (Volt Energy Utility), a minority-owned renewable energy developer focused on making clean energy investments in communities disproportionately impacted by pollution and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\nWith the EJ PPA, Hickory will contribute funding to enable Sharing the Power Foundation, a non-profit that seeks to advance environmental justice and contribute to an equitable distribution of benefits produced by the clean energy economy. The funding will help provide financial assistance to organizations and causes that ensure equal access to clean air, water, and renewable energy, as well as offer availability to energy assistance programs and opportunities to pursue workforce training in clean energy careers.\nThe companies said that in addition to providing clean energy and economic growth, the projects will also support Microsoft\u2019s sustainability and carbon reduction goals. In 2021, Microsoft launched a \u201c100\/100\/0 clean energy goal,\u201d with the company targeting having 100% of its electricity consumption, 100% percent of the time, matched by purchases from zero carbon energy sources by 2030, adding to its prior commitment to use 100% renewable energy in its buildings and datacenters globally by 2025. Microsoft has also committed to become carbon negative by 2030, and to cover 100% of its electricity consumption in its buildings and datacenters globally with renewable energy by 2025.\nKourtney Nelson, Senior Director of Renewable Energy Procurement at Microsoft, said:\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting when projects achieve commercial operations and begin generating clean energy in support of grid decarbonization. We\u2019re pleased with EDPR NA and Volt Energy Utility\u2019s collaboration on Hickory and the positive impact the project will have with community grants and investing in future renewable energy leaders.\u201d\n ",

Chestnut\u2019s projects acquire marginal crop and pasture lands, and partners with local foresters, nurseries, and community members to develop an ideal forest ecosystem based on native tree species, soil, drainage, and community land use.\nThe new agreement will provide carbon removal credits from Chestnut\u2019s afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation (ARR) project in Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana. Key features of the project highlighted by Chestnut included the durability of its carbon sequestration, and additionality, with the lands not being restored in the absence of the carbon market, as well as environmental and stakeholder benefits such as improvements to native wildlife habitats, air and water quality, expansion of land use alternatives, community engagement and economic development.\nAccording to Chestnut, the new agreement with Microsoft will enable it to grow its ARR portfolio to 500,000 acres by 2030 and to remove 100 million tons of CO2 from the atmosphere over a 50-year crediting period.\nBen Dell, CEO of Chestnut and Managing Partner of Kimmeridge, said:\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be expanding our collaboration with Microsoft given their market leadership in net zero commitments and the signing of a second agreement within the span of a year reaffirms their view that Chestnut is delivering high quality removal credits. We\u2019re confident in our belief that nature-based afforestation solutions are the most attractive, scalable, and cost-effective means for removing carbon from the atmosphere today. We continue to bring high-quality credits to market for discerning customers and look forward to building on our leading position in the market.\u201d\nThe new transaction adds to an initial 15-year agreement between Microsoft and Chestnut in December 2023 for up to 3 million tons of carbon credits, and marks a further expansion to Microsoft\u2019s diverse portfolio of carbon removal projects, forming part of the tech giant\u2019s initiative to become carbon negative by 2030. The portfolio includes several large-scale reforestation-based agreements, including a 3.5 million ton deal announced earlier this month with Brazil-based re.green, in addition to technologies including, ocean-based carbon removal, and biochar-based projects, and direct air capture (DAC) agreements.\nBrian Marrs, Senior Director of Energy & Carbon Removal at Microsoft, said:\n\u201cThis agreement with Chestnut Carbon is another positive step towards Microsoft\u2019s goal to become carbon negative by 2030. We look forward to the prospect of scaling forest restoration within the United States, attracting sophisticated private capital in the process.

The new agreement adds 17,500 hectares to the partnership, and nearly 3.5 million tonnes of carbon removals.\nThiago Picolo, CEO of re.green, said:\n\u201cSigning this second offtake agreement with Microsoft reflects our shared commitment to high-integrity nature-based solutions, with tangible results to date. Restoring these biomes, home to the planet\u2019s richest biodiversity, represents one of the greatest opportunities for large-scale decarbonization. We are thrilled to conclude another agreement with Microsoft, enhancing our impact and reaching new areas.\u201d\nBased in Rio de Janeiro, re.green aims to restore one million hectares of degraded land in the Amazon and Atlantic forests in Brazil, with a goal to capture 15 million tons of carbon per year, in addition to conserving biodiversity, sustainably managing forest products and supporting the empowerment of local communities. The company\u2019s forest restoration process includes selecting degraded lands through internally developed spatial analysis technology, using restoration models based on native and regional species, engaging and training local communities to support the restoration and protection of forests, while generating income and preserving the projects, and actively monitoring forest restoration and recovery, enabling the company to market high-quality carbon credits and forest solutions.\nAccording to the companies, the first agreement initiated last year has already resulted in the planting of more than 4.4 million seedlings spanning 80 native species across 11,000 hectares of degraded or abandoned pasturelands.\nThe new announcement expands the focus of the collaboration to three regions, including the eastern edge of the Amazon Forest Biome, Southern Bahia, at the heart of the central biodiversity corridor of the Atlantic Forest, and Vale do Para\u00edba, also in the Atlantic Forest, covering its southeast biodiversity corridor.\nIn addition to the carbon removal attributes, the companies highlighted other benefits from the projects, including the reestablishment of the diversity, structure, and function of natural forest ecosystems, increasing habitat for endemic, rare, and threatened species and fostering local development,  as well as social benefits for local communities, with hundreds of people employed in restoration efforts and other related activities.\nThe agreements form part of a rapidly growing series of carbon removal deals by Microsoft, forming part of the tech giant\u2019s initiative to become carbon negative by 2030, including several large-scale nature-based carbon removal agreements, with several focused on forest restoration, in addition to technologies including, ocean-based carbon removal, and biochar-based projects, and direct air capture (DAC) agreements.\nBrian Marrs, Senior Director of Carbon Removal and Energy at Microsoft, said:\n\u201cMicrosoft is pleased to expand its collaboration with re.green to continue advancing native-species-led restoration in Brazil.

        "full_content":"Microsoft announced the launch of a new datacenter design, optimizing AI workloads and avoiding the consumption of water for cooling, supporting the company\u2019s datacenter-focused sustainability goals.\nThe announcement follows the release by Microsoft earlier this year of its \u201cDatacenter Community Pledge,\u201d aimed at ensuring that the company\u2019s growing datacenter footprint serves helps to address societal challenges and create benefits in local communities. The pledge included a commitment  to \u201cdesign and operate our datacenters to support society\u2019s climate goals and become carbon negative, water positive and zero waste before 2030.\u201d\nDatacenters generate a great deal of heat, and generally use a chilled water circuit to absorb the heat generated by equipment. According to experts, the average mid-sized data center in the US utilizes around 300,000 gallons of water a day \u2013 as much as is used by 1,000 US households, making data centers alone among the top ten commercial and industrial users of water in the country.\nMicrosoft said that its new datacenter projects to be built in Phoenix, Arizona, and Mt. Pleasant, Wisconsin, will pilot cooling systems that do not consume water. These new datacenters are the first ones that will be based on new designs that use a next-generation cooling technology that avoids water evaporation, which the company says will save as much as 125 million liters of water per year per datacenter. The new sites will begin coming online in late 2027, Microsoft said, and all new Microsoft datacenter designs have begun using the new cooling technology.\nAccording to Microsoft, the new liquid cooling technologies recycle water through a closed loop. Water is filled into the system when the data center is under construction, and that water will continually circulate between the servers and chillers to dissipate heat without requiring a fresh water supply.\nIn addition to the new cooling design, Microsoft said it has been taking other steps to reduce water usage. Based on its Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) measurement, its efforts improved water use efficiency in its last fiscal year by 39% over the amount used in FY 2021. Those savings, Microsoft said, were in part fueled by expanded use of alternative water sources, such as reclaimed and recycled water, in data centers in Texas, Washington, California, and Singapore.\nIn a post highlighting the new design, Steve Solomon, Vice President, Datacenter Infrastructure Engineering at Microsoft, said:\n\u201cWe have been working since the early 2000s to reduce water use and improved our WUE by 80% since our first generation of datacenters. As water challenges grow more extreme, we know we have more work to do. The shift to the next generation datacenters is expected to help reduce our WUE to near zero for each datacenter employing zero-water evaporation. As our fleet expands over time, this shift will help reduce Microsoft\u2019s fleetwide WUE even further.\u201d",

While Microsoft has set 2030 goals to become carbon negative and to reduce Scope 3 emissions by more than half compared to 2020, the company recently reported that Scope 3 emissions in 2023 were actually more than 30% higher than in 2020, driven by the construction of datacenters, including embodied carbon in building materials as well as hardware components.\nConstruction materials such as steel and concrete are among the most significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with steel manufacturing and cement production accounting for approximately 7% and 8%, respectively, of global carbon emissions, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF).\nAmong the key initiatives announced by Microsoft is the use of cross-laminated timber (CLT), a lightweight, superstrong and fire-resistant prefabricated wood material in two new datacenters under construction in northern Virginia, that will enable reductions in the use of steel and concrete.\nCLT is produced by gluing together multiple layers of timber stacked in alternate directions, which is then pressed into a solid panel. Typically made of spruce, pine or Douglas fir, CLT is stronger, lighter and more stable than ordinary wood, and the material performs better than steel at high temperatures by developing a layer of char that provides insulation and maintains the integrity of the structure.\nIn the new datacenters, CLT will be used to displace a portion of the thick concrete typically used for flooring and ceilings, resulting in a much lighter building requiring much less steel.\nAccording to Microsoft, the use of CLT in the new datacenters is estimated to reduce embodied carbon for the facilities by 35% compared to conventional steel construction, and by 65% compared to typical precast concrete.\nJim Hanna, who leads sustainability for Microsoft\u2019s datacenter engineering team, said:\n\u201cWe have to be system thinkers across the entire value chain of these materials that go into our datacenters and the equipment that supplies our datacenters.\u201d\nAdditional initiatives the company said it is taking to reduce the embodied carbon footprint of its datacenters include updating contract language to include low-carbon requirements for materials and equipment used in datacenter construction, and investments in low-carbon building materials technologies and developers, such as Stegra (formerly H2 Green Steel), Boston Metal, CarbonCure, and Prometheus Materials through the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund.\nBrandon Middaugh, who manages the Climate Innovation Fund program and strategy, said:\n\u201cPart of the solution is (figuring out) how do you make sure that our suppliers have the enabling technologies they need to develop the green solution.\u201d\nImage source: Microsoft",

Through Puro.earth\u2019s platform, and based on its carbon credit methodologies, suppliers that remove CO2 from the atmosphere to durable storage of at least 100 years are certified and issued CO2 Removal Certificates (CORCs) into the Puro Registry, which can then be purchased by companies.\nPuro.earth said that it took nearly five years from its first CORCs issuances in 2019 to reach 500,000 issued CORCs in Q1 2024, with growth growing exponentially to reach 1 million CORCs only one year later.\nThe company added that it is on track for issuance of the next million CORCs before the end of H1 2026.\nPuro.earth President Jan-Willem Bode said:\n\u201cReaching one million of CO\u2082 removals is just the beginning\u2014our goal is to continue to use our expertise and track record to deliver proven, scalable and high-quality carbon removal credits. The next million is already within reach, and we will continue to ensure that businesses worldwide have access to trusted, verifiable carbon removal credits, at scale.\u201d\nBy methodology, Puro.earth said that Geologically Stored Carbon (GSC)\u2013 such as Direct Air Capture Carbon and Storage (DACCS) and Bio Energy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) \u2013 and Biochar, have been particularly popular with buyers, each representing more than 34% of issuances, as they offer scalable, high-impact solutions for carbon removal with well-defined processes and measurable outcomes. By location, the U.S. leads issuances by a wide margin, at 45%, followed by Finland at 9.9%, Bolivia at 9.6% and Brazil at 9.2%., with other strong markets including Austria, Norway, and the UK.\nPuro.earth attributed shifting buyer sentiment as a key factor in the sector\u2019s growth, noting buyers such as Microsoft, Google, and the Frontier Buyers that have led in the development of the early-stage durable CDR market, allowing technologies and suppliers to scale. It added that the market is seeing increased interest from buyers in hard-to-abate sectors, such as aviation, concrete, steel manufacturing, shipping, and chemical production.\nAntti Vihavainen, Vice Chairman of Puro.earth, said:\n\u201cWe want to thank the key players that have come together to build the CDR market with us: the courageous investors who ventured into the unknown, the pioneering entrepreneurs who chose innovation over business-as-usual, and the forward-thinking buyers whose commitments make everything move.\u201d",

Under the agreement, Inherit will implement its system to capture CO2 from a biogas plant in Denmark. Once captured, the CO2 will be liquified and transported for geological storage under the North Sea.\nNordea announced a commitment in 2021 to become a net zero bank by 2050, along with a series of interim 2030 targets including reductions in carbon emissions from lending and investment portfolios by 40-50%, reductions in internal carbon emissions by at least 50% and the achievement of net positive carbon contribution.\nThe firm said that by the end of 2024, it had reduced emissions from its own operations by 53% compared with 2019, and with its goal to achieve net positive carbon contribution by 2030, it aims for the amount of high-quality carbon removal credits to exceed the unabated emissions from its own operations.\nPeter Sandahl, Head of Climate & Environment at Nordea said:\n\u201cThis agreement is a milestone in Nordea\u2019s new carbon removal strategy and reflects our ambition to support the scaling of high-quality carbon removal technologies. . .Through this commitment we are accelerating our operational sustainability efforts and, in addition, supporting the scaling of innovative solutions essential to reach long-term climate goals and keeping global warming within the boundaries of the Paris Agreement.\u201d\nFounded in 2021, Oslo, Norway-based Inherit captures and permanently stores CO2 released from production of renewable natural gas (RNG), which is produced from organic waste, such as agricultural, industrial, and household wastes. Unlike other carbon removal solutions, CO2 captured from RNG production doesn\u2019t have to be separated from other materials as It is created during the production of RNG, which does not contribute to climate change and is used as a fuel in the Nordics and elsewhere. After capturing carbon from biogas plants, Inherit liquifies the CO2 and transports it for permanent geological storage.\nKaja Voss, Co-CEO of Inherit, said:\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with Nordea on this groundbreaking project and to see that Nordea goes to such great lengths to accelerate the carbon removal industry. Together, we\u2019re taking an important step towards a net zero future, and we look forward to this collaboration going forward.\u201d",

        "full_content":"UBS revealed in its 2024 Sustainability Report that it has pushed back its target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in its operations by 10 years to 2035, from its prior 2025 goal, attributing the change largely due to the effect of the bank\u2019s acquisition of Credit Suisse.\nThe bank also withdrew a target for its Asset Management division to align 20% of its assets under management (AUM) with net zero by 2030, saying that it is reviewing the goal due to the integration of Credit Suisse.\nThe announcement by UBS marks the latest in a series of moves by banks globally to withdraw or pull back on climate commitments, although UBS\u2019 changes appear less drastic than those by some of its peers. HSBC, for example, recently pushed back its own target to achieve net zero emissions in its operations and supply chain by 20 years to 2050, and placed its interim financed emissions targets under review, all major U.S., Canadian and some other banks have left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, and Wells Fargo entirely dropped its target to achieve net zero financed emissions by 2050, and its sector-specific 2030 interim financed emissions targets.\nUBS remains a member of the NZBA, and in its report, the bank confirmed that it remains committed to its financed emissions decarbonization targets. UBS has 2030 financed emissions goals in place for the Swiss residential and commercial real estate, power generation, iron and steel, cement, and fossil fuel sectors.\nThe report, however, changed language on UBS\u2019 key climate commitments from its 2023 report, in which the bank said that \u201cby 2050, our ambition is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across our scope 1 and 2, and specified scope 3 activities,\u201d updating it with \u201cby 2050, the global economy aims to transition to net zero. For example, across our own operations (scopes 1 and 2), UBS plans to achieve net zero by 2035, well ahead of 2050,\u201d and outlining its Scope 3 goal as \u201caddressing our financed emissions by aligning specified sectors to decarbonization pathways.\u201d\nUBS attributed the change in its operational net zero goal to its \u201cenlarged corporate real estate portfolio following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group,\u201d as well as to \u201cthe latest definition of a \u201cnet-zero target\u201d in the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).\u201d\nAlongside the updated net zero target, UBS also set out a new interim goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 57% by 2030, on a 2023 baseline, as well as a commitment to source 100% of electricity from renewable-source-qualifying generation by 2026. For the 2035 net zero target, UBS said that it aims to reduce emissions by at least 90% before neutralizing any residual emissions through the purchase of carbon removal credits, while the interim 2030 goal does not include the use of any carbon removal credits.\nIn its Asset Management business, UBS said that it withdrew its 2030 target as it is \u201creviewing the legacy target set prior to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, taking into account all of the AuM of the combined businesses.\u201d In the report, UBS said that its assets under management with a net zero ambition reached $64.4 billion, or 3.6% of AUM (including Credit Suisse AUM), up from $35.5 billion and 2.9% of AUM in 2023 (excluding Credit Suisse AUM).",

The plan focuses on six key pillars, including ensuring access to clean and affordable energy, preventing carbon leakage, strengthening European industrial capacities, promoting circularity for metals, defending quality industrial jobs, and de-risking projects through lead markets and public support.\nThe release marks the second Action Plan, after one focused on the automotive sector, to be launched by the Commission under its new \u201cCompetitiveness Compass\u201d roadmap to boost Europe\u2019s productivity and global competitiveness. The roadmap included plans to introduce in 2025 \u201ctailor-made action plans\u201d for key energy-intensive industries, as well as plans for initiatives including a proposed \u201cIndustrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act\u201d targeting streamlined permitting for renewable energy for emissions-intensive sectors, and a review of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\nWithin the pillars focused on sector decarbonization, the Commission unveiled a series of initiatives and plans aimed at boosting the industry\u2019s access to and use of clean energy, promoting investment in clean technologies, and de-risking emissions reduction investments for companies.\nKey actions to increase the use of clean energy include promoting the use of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), encouraging member states to reduce network tariffs to alleviate electricity price volatility, promoting faster grid access and supporting the increased use of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen.\nSustainability-focused funding and incentives highlighted by the plan include plans to mobilize \u20ac100 billion in funding at scale-up stage through the \u201cIndustrial Decarbonisation Bank\u201d announced in February in the Clean Industrial Deal, starting with a \u20ac1 billion pilot auction in 2025 focusing on decarbonizing and electrifying key industrial processes.\nThe Action Plan also aims to implement measures to address \u201ccarbon leakage\u201d in the sector, a situation in which companies move production of emissions intensive goods to countries with less stringent environmental and climate policies, through revisions to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the EU\u2019s carbon tax on imported goods. Plans include introducing a legislative proposal later this year to extend the scope of CBAM to certain steel and aluminium-based downstream products and to include additional anti-circumvention measures.\nAdditionally, the Action Plan includes a series of actions aimed at boosting circularity in the metals industry, including plans to set targets for recycled steel and aluminium in key sectors, assessing whether products such as construction materials and electronics should have recycling or recycled content requirements, and considering trade measures on metal scrap to ensure sufficient availability of scrap.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said:\n\u201cThe steel industry has always been a core engine for European prosperity. Next-generation, clean steel should therefore continue to be manufactured in Europe. That means we have to help our steelmakers who are facing strong headwinds on the global market. To make sure they remain competitive, we must reduce energy costs and help them introduce innovative, low-carbon technologies to the market. With today\u2019s Action Plan we are offering concrete solutions for a thriving European steel industry.\u201d",

        "full_content":"In his first act as Canada\u2019s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney signed an order on Friday eliminating a controversial consumer carbon tax, the \u201cfuel charge,\u201d effective April 1, 2025.\nIntroduced in 2019, the fuel charge aimed to introduce a price on carbon for businesses and consumers in order to incentivize emissions reductions and to adopt cleaner technologies and products. The carbon tax started at $20 per tonne in 2019, and has been increasing annually, and was set to reach $170 per tonne in 2030.\nThe elimination of the fuel charge follows a campaign by Canada\u2019s Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre over the past several months against the carbon tax, as consumers faced high inflation. Despite championing the carbon tax in the past, Carney\u2019s campaign for Liberal party leadership acknowledged that it \u201cisn\u2019t working and has become too divisive,\u201d and pledged to cancel it.\nCarney takes the office of Prime Minister with a strong resume in both finance and climate action. He has served as the Governor of the both the Banks of Canada and of England, as the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance, as the UK Prime Minister\u2019s Finance Adviser for the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference, and as co-Chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). Prior to running for Liberal leadership, he was serving as Chair and Head of Transition Investing at Brookfield Asset Management, focused on ESG investing.\nWhile the consumer carbon tax will be ending, the carbon price on businesses will remain in place. In his leadership campaign, Carney pledged to ensure that \u201cCanada\u2019s biggest emitters will contribute their fair share,\u201d with a plan to tighten the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS) for large, industrial emitters, and to introduce a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), or a carbon tax on imports designed to prevent \u201ccarbon leakage,\u201d a situation in which companies move production of emissions intensive goods to countries with less stringent environmental and climate policies. Carney also pledged to introduce incentives for green buildings and transport electrification, and for consumer investments such as home retrofits and heat pump installations.\nIn a presentation announcing the elimination of the consumer carbon tax, Carney said:\n\u201cThis will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians, but it is part of a much bigger set of measures that this government is taking to ensure that we fight against climate change, that our companies are competitive, and the country moves forward.\u201d",

The proposal would also block any adverse actions taken against companies in relation to the regulations.\nSenator Hagerty said:\n\u201cAmerican companies should be governed by U.S. laws, not unaccountable lawmakers in foreign capitals. The European Union\u2019s ideologically motivated regulatory overreach is an affront to U.S. sovereignty. I will use every tool at my disposal to block it.\u201d\nThe introduction of the legislation follows the publication of a letter by the Senate Banking Committee Chairman to Trump administration officials in February expressing concerns about the potential impact of the EU\u2019s CSDDD regulation on U.S. companies, and urging the administration to \u201cengage with European counterparts to vocalize direct opposition and encourage an indefinite pause on its implementation.\u201d",

        "full_content":"The UK Government\u2019s Department for Transport announced the launch of a new consultation on an initiative aimed at supporting producers of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through the establishment of a \u201crevenue certainty mechanism\u201d (RCM) to be funded by jet-fuel suppliers.\nFuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector\u2019s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.\nThe new consultation follows the launch in January by the government of the SAF Mandate, requiring the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK\u2019s jet fuel mix, starting at 2% in 2025, and ramping up to 22% by 2040.\nEfforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.\nAmong the key barriers to ramping up SAF production is the high start-up cost, with the government estimating investments of \u00a3600 million to \u00a32 billion for new commercial plants to reach economies of scale, with new plants struggling to secure investments due to risks such as revenue uncertainty and fluctuating fuel prices.\nAccording to the Department for Transport, the new RCM plan will help to reduce risk by introducing an industry funded price guarantee to ensure steady income flow for producers, even if SAF prices fluctuate, and giving investors confidence to invest in SAF plants in the UK.\nThe consultation outlines the government\u2019s position that the RCM should be funded by industry, with a preferred approach to introduce a variable levy on suppliers of jet fuel. The proposal follows the \u201cpolluter pays principle\u201d for hard to abate sectors, and is consistent with existing schemes for renewable electricity and hydrogen. The government stated that the mechanism allows the cost to be spread across the supply chain, ensuring that it is borne by those benefiting from the supply of fossil aviation fuel.\nAviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:\n\u201cWe are committed to building the technology and fuel supply that will see greener flying become a reality in a way that protects consumers.\n\u201cAs part of our Plan for Change, these proposals will power up SAF production in the UK, support thousands of green jobs and bolster expansion plans.\u201d\nThe consultation will run until the end of March, with plans for a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Revenue Support Mechanism) Bill to be brought to Parliament in the Spring.
